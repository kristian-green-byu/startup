# CS260 Notes
These notes comprise all my notes for CS260, and they may also be used on exams.
### Git Hub Commands
From the GitHub lesson, several useful commands were shown.

git clone
>clones a repository

git add <file_name> 
>adds a file to a repository

git commit -am "your comment here"
>will commit a change to a repository along with a comment.

git push 
>uploads the changes from your development environment to VSCode

git fetch
>gets the latest information about the changes on GitHub without actually changing your local repository.

git status
>shows the differences between the clones and see that we are missing as a commit.

git pull
>makes your development clone and the GitHub clone the same.

Removing conflicts
>You can remove conflicts by modifying the file to remove the textual conflict delimiters
and modifying the file to keep the changes we want. When we are done editing, our file contains what we want from both commits.

## HTML Info


## Elements and tags

HTML `elements` are represented with enclosing `tags` that may enclose other elements or text. For example, the paragraph element, and its associated tag (`p`), designate that the text is a structural paragraph of text. When we talk about tags we are referring to a delimited textual name that we use to designate the start and end of an HTML element as it appears in an HTML document. Tags are delimited with the less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) symbols. A closing tag will also have a forward slash (`/`) before its name.

```html
<p>Hello world</p>
```

## Attributes

Every HTML element may have attributes. Attributes describe the specific details of the element. For example, the `id` attribute gives a unique ID to the element so that you can distinguish it from other elements. The `class` attribute is another common element attribute that designates the element as being classified into a named group of elements. Attributes are written inside the element tag with a name followed by an optional value. You can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) to delimit attribute values.

```html
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```

## Hyperlinks

One of the core features that made the web so successful was the ability to create hyperlinks that take you from one page to another another with a simple click. A hyperlink in HTML is represented with an anchor (`a`) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (`href`). A hyperlink to BYU's home page looks like this:

```html
<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```

## Comments

You can include comments in your HTML files by starting the comment with `<!--` and ending it with `-->`. Any text withing a comment block will be completely ignored when the browser renders it.

```html
<!-- commented text -->
```

## Special characters

HTML uses several reserved characters for defining its file format. If you want to use those characters in your content then you need to escape them using the `entity` syntax. For example, to display a less than symbol (`<`) you would instead use the less than entity (`&lt;`). You can also use the entity syntax to represent any unicode character.

| Character | Entity      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| &amp;     | `&amp;`     |
| <         | `&lt;`      |
| >         | `&gt;`      |
| "         | `&quot;`    |
| '         | `&apos;`    |
| &#128512; | `&#128512;` |

## Block and inline

There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element `div` (division) could have an inline element `b` in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a `p` (paragraph) element could have a `span` to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

```html
<div>He said <b>don't</b> cross the beams.</div>

<p>Authors such as <span>ee cummings</span> often used unconventional structure.</p>
```

## Form element

The main purpose of the `form` element is to submit the values of the inputs it contains. Before JavaScript was introduced the `form` container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input. With JavaScript we have much more control over input data and what is done with it. For example, in a single page application the JavaScript will dynamically rebuild the HTML elements to reflect the results of the user interaction. With this ability the data may not even be sent to the server. This greatly reduces the necessity of the `form` element, but it is often still used simply as a container. Just remember that you are not required to have a form element to use input elements.

Here is an example of a simple form that submits the value of a `textarea` element.

```html
<form action="submission.html" method="post">
  <label for="ta">TextArea: </label>
  <textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">
Some text
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server. The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's `name` attribute with the current value of the textarea.

```
ta-id=Some+text
```

## Input element

The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the `type` attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

In order to create an input you specify the desired `type` attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

```html
<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label> <input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
```

Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

| Attribute | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form |
| disabled  | Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input                        |
| value     | The initial value of the input                                                      |
| required  | Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid                             |

The following shows what the inputs look like when rendered. Don't worry about how clunky they look right out of the box. We will fix that when we start styling things with CSS.

![HTML Input](htmlInput.jpg)

## Validating input

Several of the input elements have validation built into them. This means that they will not accept a value that is not for example, a number, a URL, outside of a range, or an email address. You can also specify the `required` attribute on an input element to mark it as requiring a value before it can be submitted. The `pattern` attribute exists on `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password` inputs. When present, the pattern attribute provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered as valid.

You should also have validation built into your JavaScript that checks input data to ensure everything is valid before it is submitted. All of the input elements support functions for determining their validation state. Additionally, there are CSS style selectors for visualizing the validity of the input. In order to have a good user experience, it is critical that you provide sufficient user feedback early in the input process. A good design will give feedback as, or before, the user begins to input. A poor design will keep the user guessing as to why the data is not being accepted, or even if it was accepted.

# HTML media elements

The HTML elements that represent media include `img`, `audio`, `video`, `svg`, and `canvas`. The `img`, `audio`, and `video` elements are all simple references to an external file, but `svg` and `canvas` both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.

## External media

The media tags that reference external media all take a URL as an attribute. The path represented by the URL can either be a relative path or full path. A full path includes the protocol, domain name, and path to the file.

```html
https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg
```

A relative path references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element. You want to make the path as relative as possible so that you can move your code around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references. For example, if your HTML page is located in a directory with a subdirectory named `images` that contains a file named `photo.jpg` you would use a relative path as follows.

```html
images/photo.jpg
```

### Image

To include an image in your content you use the `img` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source image.
In order to support accessibility, you should also include an `alt` attribute that describes the image. A full img element would look like the following.

```html
<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />
```

![mountain landscape](htmlImage.jpg)

### Audio

To include an audio file in your content you use the `audio` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source audio file. You can include the `controls` attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The `autoplay` attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the `loop` attribute keeps it playing over and over.

⚠ Note that automatically playing audio is strongly discouraged unless you provide a way for the user to opt-in to that behavior.

```html
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

![Html Audio](htmlAudioImg.jpg)

### Video

To include a video in your content you use the `video` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the `controls` or `autoplay` attributes.

⚠ Note that you may need to include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.

```html
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```

![HTML video](htmlVideoImg.jpg)

## Internal media

The internal media elements `svg` and `canvas` allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.

### Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
</svg>
```

![SVG demo](htmlSvg.jpg)

When combined with JavaScript and CSS you can produce some amazing visualizations. Checkout this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/mdKjMLY) for an example.

Consult the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) if you are interested in learning more about SVG.

### Canvas

The `canvas` element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.

```html
<canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
<script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
</script>
```

```css
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```

The selector `p` selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a sans-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.

## Associating CSS with HTML

There are three ways that you can associate CSS with HTML. The first way is to use the `style` attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.

```html
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```

The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML `style` element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The `style` element should appear in the `head` element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```

The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML `link` element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The `link` element must appear in the `head` element of the document.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

**styles.css**

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```

All of the above examples are equivalent, but using the `link` element usually is the preferred way to define CSS.

## Cascading styles

Because elements inherit the rules applied to their parents you often end up with the same declaration property applied to a single element multiple times. For example, we might set color property for all `body` elements to be red, and then `paragraph` elements to be green, and then `span` elements to be blue, and finally use a style element on a specific `span` to be black.

```html
<body>
  <p><span style="color:black">CSS</span></p>
</body>
```

```css
body {
  color: red;
}
p {
  color: green;
}
span {
  color: blue;
}
```

In this case, the rules cascade down from the highest nodes in the DOM tree to the lowest level. Any declaration property defined at a lower level will override the higher declaration. You can see this happening if you use the browser's debugger. In Chrome right click on the element and select `inspect`. You can then click on each element in the debugger and see what the value of the color property is. For the case defined above you will see that each of the higher level declarations is crossed out until you get to the style explicitly defined on the element.

## The box model

CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.

![CSS box model](boxmodelcss.png)

By default, the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box. You can change the `box-sizing` CSS property from the default value of `content-box` to `border-box` in order to redefine the width and height to also include the padding and the border. This often makes it easier to style elements when their visual size matches their actual size.

The first step in understanding CSS is mastering how to select the elements that a CSS rule applies to. The CSS rule selector can take many forms. In order to explain the most common selectors we need some demonstration HTML. Let's image a simple document describing the departments in a university. In our case we have a physics and a chemistry department. The information provided is very sparse, but the structure provided by the HTML is enough to work with.

```html
<body>
  <h1>Departments</h1>
  <p>welcome message</p>
  <section id="physics">
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
  <section id="chemistry">
    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
</body>
```

By default every browser defines a base set of styles that it applies to all HTML. This varies slightly from browser to browser, but for the most part our document would render like this using the base browser styles.

![CSS selectors base]([cssSelectorBase.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webprogramming260/.github/main/profile/css/selectors/cssSelectorBase.jpg))

We would like to style our document so that it looks like this when we are done.

![CSS selectors final]([cssSelectorFinal.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webprogramming260/.github/main/profile/css/selectors/cssSelectorFinal.jpg))

## Element type selector

To start things off, we want to make all elements in the document use a sans-serif font. We can do this by using an element name selector. By selecting the `body` element we will cascade our declaration down to all the children of the body, which is the whole document.

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

Note that we could also use the wildcard element name selector (`*`) to select all elements, but for our needs the `body` element will work just fine.

We can also use element name selectors to give a bottom border to the top level heading (`h1`), as well as modify the section elements to pop out with a gray background and some white space in the padding and margins.

```css
h1 {
  border-bottom: thin black solid;
}

section {
  background: #eeeeee;
  padding: 0.25em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}
```

## Combinators

Next we want to change the color of the second level headings (`h2`), but we only want to do that within the sections for each department. To make that happen we can provide a `descendant combinator` that is defined with a space delimited list of values where each item in the list is a descendant of the previous item. So our selector would be all `h2` elements that are descendants of `section` elements.

```css
section h2 {
  color: #004400;
}
```

There are other types of combinators that you can use. These include the following.

| Combinator       | Meaning                    | Example        | Description                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Descendant       | A list of descendants      | `body section` | Any section that is a descendant of a body |
| Child            | A list of direct children  | `section > p`  | Any p that is a direct child of a section  |
| General sibling  | A list of siblings         | `p ~ div`      | Any p that has a div sibling               |
| Adjacent sibling | A list of adjacent sibling | `p + div`      | Any p that has an adjacent div sibling     |

We can use the general sibling combinator to increase the whitespace padding on the left of paragraphs that are siblings of a level two heading.

```css
h2 ~ p {
  padding-left: 0.5em;
}
```

## Class selector

The next selector we will use is the class selector. Remember that any element can have zero or more classifications applied to it. For example, our document has a class of `introduction` applied to the first paragraph, and a class of `summary` applied to the final paragraph of each section. If we want to bold the summary paragraphs we would supply the class name summary prefixed with a period (`.summary`).

```css
.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

You can also combine the element name and class selectors to select all paragraphs with a class of summary.

```css
p.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## ID selector

ID selectors reference the ID of an element. All IDs should be unique within an HTML document and so this select targets a specific element. To use the ID selector you prefix the ID with the hash symbol (`#`). We would like to showcase our physics department by putting a thin purple border along the left side of the physics section.

```css
#physics {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
```

## Attribute selector

Attribute selectors allow you to select elements based upon their attributes. You use an attribute selector to select any element with a given attribute (`a[href]`). You can also specify a required value for an attribute (`a[href="./fish.png"]`) in order for the selector to match. Attribute selectors also support wildcards such as the ability to select attribute values containing specific text (`p[href*="https://"]).

```css
p[class='summary'] {
  color: red;
}
```

## Pseudo selector

CSS also defines a significant list of pseudo selectors which select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, and attributes. We will give just one example. Suppose we want our purple highlight bar to appear only when the mouse hovers over the text. To accomplish this we can change our ID selector to select whenever a section is hovered over.

```css
section:hover {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
```
# CSS Declarations

CSS rule declarations specify a property and value to assign when the rule selector matches one or more elements. There are legions of possible properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document. For our purposes we will discuss just a few of the more commonly used ones so that you can get a feel for wide variety of functionality they represent.

## Units

You can use a variety of units when defining the size of a CSS property. For example, the width of an element can be defined using absolute units such as the number of pixels (`px`) or inches (`in`). You can also use relative units such as a percentage of the parent element (`50%`), a percentage of a minimum viewport dimension (`25vmin`), or a multiplier of the size of the letter m (`1.5rem`) as defined by the root element.

```css
p {
  width: 25%;
  height: 30vh;
}
```

Here is a list of the most commonly used units. All of the units are prefixed with a number when used as a property value.

| Unit | Description                                                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| px   | The number of pixels                                             |
| pt   | The number of points (1/72 of an inch)                           |
| in   | The number of inches                                             |
| cm   | The number of centimeters                                        |
| %    | A percentage of the parent element                               |
| em   | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the parent's font |
| rem  | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the root's font   |
| ex   | A multiplier of the height of the element's font                 |
| vw   | A percentage of the viewport's width                             |
| vh   | A percentage of the viewport's height                            |
| vmin | A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension                 |
| vmax | A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension                  |

## Color


CSS defines multiple ways to describe color, ranging from representations familiar to programmers and ones familiar to layout designers and artists.

| Method       | Example                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| keyword      | `red`                     | A set of predefined colors (e.g. white, cornflowerblue, darkslateblue)                                                                                                                                            |
| RGB hex      | `#00FFAA22` or `#0FA2`    | Red, green, and blue as a hexadecimal number, with an optional alpha opacity                                                                                                                                      |
| RGB function | `rgb(128, 255, 128, 0.5)` | Red, green, and blue as a percentage or number between 0 and 255, with an optional alpha opacity percentage                                                                                                       |
| HSL          | `hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)` | Hue, saturation, and light, with an optional opacity percentage. Hue is the position on the 365 degree color wheel (red is 0 and 255). Saturation is how gray the color is, and light is how bright the color is. |

# CSS Fonts

The CSS `font-family` property defines what fonts should be used. The property value represents an ordered list of fonts. The first font in the list that is available will be used. This ability to select from a list of fonts is important because different operating systems have different default fonts and your first choice may not be available.

## Font families

There are four major families of fonts: `Serif`, `sans-serif`, `fixed`, and `symbol`. A serif is a small stroke attached to the ends of a character's major strokes. Serif fonts have the extra strokes; sans-serif fonts do not. Fixed fonts characters all are the same size. This is useful for lining up text when doing things like coding or displaying tabular data. Symbol fonts represent non-language characters such as arrows or emojis.

## Importing fonts

In addition to referencing standard fonts found on the user's computer you can specify a font that you provide with your application. That way your application is guaranteed to always look the same. In order to have the browser load a font you use the `@font-face` rule and provide the font name and source location.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.woff2');
}

p {
  font-family: Quicksand;
}
```

If you do not want to host font files on your server, then you can load them from a font provider. For example, Google provides a large selection of [open source fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) that you can use without paying any royalties. The easiest way to use Google fonts is to use a CSS import statement to reference the Google Font Service. This will automatically generate the CSS for importing the font.

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

p {
  font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
}
```
# CSS Animation

Using CSS to animate your components is an easy way to make your application feel alive and interactive. You create CSS animations using the `animation` properties and defining `keyframes` for what the element should look like at different times in the animation. Let's walk through an example.

We have a paragraph of centered text and we want it to zoom in until its size is 20% of the view height.

```css
p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;
}
```

To make this happen we specify that we are animating the selected elements by adding the `animation-name` property with a value of demo. This name refers to the name of the `keyframes` that we will specify in a minute. The keyframes tell what CSS properites should be applied at different key points in the animation sequence. We also add an `animation-duration` property in order to specify that the animation should last for three seconds.

```css
p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;

  animation-name: demo;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
```

Now we are ready to create the keyframes. We don't have to define what happens at every millisecond of the animation. Instead we only need to define the key points, and CSS will generate a smooth transition to move from one keyframe to another. In our case we simply want to start with text that is invisible and have it zoom into the full final size. We can do this with two frames that are designated with the keywords `from` and `to`.

```css
@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
```

That's everything we need to do. However, let's make one more addition. It would look better if towards the end, the paragraph bounced out a little bigger than its final size. We can accommodate that by adding another key frame that happens 95 percent through the animation.

```css
@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  95% {
    font-size: 21vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
```
# Responsive design


Modern web applications are expected to run well on a large variety of computing devices. This includes everything from desktops, to mobile phones, to shopping kiosks, to car dashboards. This ability to reconfigure the interface so the application accommodates and takes advantage of the screen's size and orientation is called `responsive design`.

Much of HTML and CSS is already fluid due to the fact that it responds to the browser window being resized. For example a paragraph element will resize when the browser window is resized. However, the following features can completely change the layout of the application based on the device's size and orientation.

## Display


The CSS display property allows you to change how an HTML element is displayed by the browser. The common options for the display property include the following.

| Value  | Meaning                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none   | Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.                                    |
| block  | Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A `p` or `div` element has block display by default.        |
| inline | Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A `b` or `span` element has inline display by default. |
| flex   | Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.                                                                   |
| grid   | Display this element's children in a grid orientation.                                                                       |

We can demonstrate the different CSS display property values with the following HTML that contains a bunch of `div` elements. By default `div` elements have a display property value of `block`.

```html
<div class="none">None</div>
<div class="block">Block</div>
<div class="inline">Inline1</div>
<div class="inline">Inline2</div>
<div class="flex">
  <div>FlexA</div>
  <div>FlexB</div>
  <div>FlexC</div>
  <div>FlexD</div>
</div>
<div class="grid">
  <div>GridA</div>
  <div>GridB</div>
  <div>GridC</div>
  <div>GridD</div>
</div>
```


If we modify the display property associated with each element with the following CSS, then we get a totally different rendering.

```css
.none {
  display: none;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}

.flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```


## Viewport meta tag

When smart mobile devices started gaining popularity they began to be used to view websites. However, the websites were optimized for desktop displays and not little tiny mobile screens. To solve this mobile browsers automatically started scaling the website so that it looked better on a small screen. Unfortunately, as web applications started being responsive to the screen size, the mobile browser's scaling got in the way. The solution is to include a meta tag in the `head` element of all your HTML pages. This tells the browser to not scale the page.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
```

## Float

The float css property moves an element to the left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it. For example, if we had an `aside` element followed by a large paragraph of text, we could create the following CSS rule in order to cause the text to wrap around the aside.

```css
aside {
  float: right;
  padding: 3em;
  margin: 0.5em;
  border: black solid thin;
}
```

When the browser resizes, the text will flow around the floating element.

## Media queries

One of the main CSS features for creating responsive applications is the `@media` selector. This selector dynamically detects the size and orientation of the device and applies CSS rules to represent the structure of the HTML in a way that accommodates the change.

We can use the `@media` selector to tell us which side of the screen (technically the viewport) is the longest. A media query takes one or more predicates separated by boolean operators. In our case we simply want to know if the screen is oriented in portrait mode (short side on top) or not. If it is then we transform all of our div elements by rotating them 270 degrees.

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  div {
    transform: rotate(270deg);
  }
}
```

You can also use media queries to make entire pieces of your application disappear, or move to a different location. For example, if we had an aside that was helpful when the screen is wide, but took up too much room when the screen got narrow, we could use the following media query to make it disappear.

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  aside {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
# CSS Grid

The `grid` display layout is useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid. We start with a container element that has a bunch of child elements.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
</div>
```

We turn this into a responsive grid by including a CSS `display` property with the value of `grid` on the container element. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a grid flow. The next property, `grid-template-columns`, specifies the layout of the grid columns. In this example we say that we want to repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (`1fr`) of the grid width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts for each of the children.

We finish off the grid configuration by saying that we want all rows to be exactly 300 pixels high with the `grid-auto-rows` property and the use the `grid-gap` property to say that we want at least a 1 em gap between our grid items.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```
# CSS Flexbox

The `flex` display layout is useful when you want to partition your application into areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes. In order to demonstrate the power of flex we will build an application that has a header, footer, and a main content area that is split into two sections, with controls of the left and content on the right.

So we can visualize our design by quickly sketching it out.

Next we build our structural HTML to match our design.

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>CSS flex &amp; media query</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Controls</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Content</h2>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <h2>Footer</h2>
  </footer>
</body>
```

Now we can use Flexbox to make it all come alive. We make the body element into a responsive flexbox by including the CSS `display` property with the value of `flex`. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a flex flow. We want our top level flexbox children to be column oriented and so we add the `flex-direction` property with a value of `column`. We then add some simple other declarations to zero out the margin and fill the entire viewport with our application frame.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 0;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

To get the division of space for the flexbox children correct we add the following flex properties to each of the children.

- **header** - `flex: 0 80px` - Zero means it will not grow and 80px means it has a starting basis height of 80 pixels. This creates a fixed size box.
- **footer** - `flex: 0 30px` - Like the header it will not grow and has a height of 30 pixels.
- **main** - `flex: 1` - One means it will get one fractional unit of growth, and since it is the only child with a non-zero growth value, it will get all the remaining space. Main also gets some additional properties because we want it to also be a flexbox container for the controls and content area. So we set its display to be `flex` and specify the `flex-direction` to be row so that the children are oriented side by side.

```css
header {
  flex: 0 80px;
  background: hsl(223, 57%, 38%);
}

footer {
  flex: 0 30px;
  background: hsl(180, 10%, 10%);
}

main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

Now we just need to add CSS to the control and content areas represented by the two child section elements. We want the controls to have 25% of the space and the content to have the remaining. So we set the `flex` property value to 1 and 3 respectively. That means that the controls get one unit of space and the content gets three units of space. No matter how we resize things this ratio will responsively remain.

```css
section:nth-child(1) {
  flex: 1;
  background-color: hsl(180, 10%, 80%);
}
section:nth-child(2) {
  flex: 3;
  background-color: white;
}
```

## Media Query

That completes our original design, but we also want to handle small screen sizes. To do this, we add some media queries that drop the header and footer if the viewport gets too short, and orient the main sections as rows if it gets too narrow.

To support the narrow screen (portrait mode), we include a media query that detects when we are in portrait orientation and sets the `flex-direction` of the main element to be column instead of row. This causes the children to be stacked on top of each other instead of side by side.

To handle making our header and footer disappear when the screen is to short to display them, we use a media query that triggers when our viewport height has a maximum value of 700 pixels. When that is true we change the `display` property for both the header and the footer to `none` so that they will be hidden. When that happens the main element becomes the only child and since it has a flex value of 1, it takes over everything.

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  main {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}

@media (max-height: 700px) {
  header {
    display: none;
  }
  footer {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
# Debugging CSS


CSS is extremely powerful, but sometimes is can be very frustrating to figure out why your page is not rendering the way that you expect. To help you understand why things are rendering the way they are you can use the browser's developer tool to inspect the CSS properties and visualize the HTML layout. Using the Google Chrome debugger you can access the developer tools by right clicking on the HTML page element that you want to debug and selecting the `inspect` option. You can experience this by creating a directory that contains the following content, composed of an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`index.css`). 


Open the directory with VS Code and use the Live Server extension to view the HTML in the Chrome browser. In the browser, right click on the text and select `inspect`. This will open the debugger window and display the `Elements` tab. As you move your cursor over the different elements you will visually see what the padding, borders, and margins are set to. The `Styles` pane shows all of the CSS properties applied to the currently selected element. If you scroll down to the bottom of the styles pane you will see the CSS box. By moving the cursor over the different parts of the CSS box it will highlight the different box parts in the browser window.

You can change any of the CSS properties, and even add new properties, directly in the debugger. This allows you to see what each property is contributing and change them to see how that impacts the rendering. This is a great way to figure out what CSS works best without having to continually change the CSS file and refresh the browser.

# CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks provide functions and components that commonly appear in web applications. As web developers built more and more web applications they began to use the same patterns over and over. They combined these patterns into a shared package of code and contributed it to the world as open source repositories. This helped not only decrease the time to develop an application, but created a common user experience for the web in general.

Today, there are lots of different open source CSS frameworks available to choose from. Many of them contain the same types of functionality, but they all bring something a little different to the table.


## Tailwind


Tailwind takes a different approach than traditional CSS frameworks. Instead of using large, rich, CSS rulesets to compartmentalize styling and functionality, it uses smaller definitions that are applied specifically to individual HTML elements. This moves much of the CSS representation out of the CSS file and directly into the HTML.

```html
<div class="pt-6 md:p-8 text-center md:text-left space-y-4">
  <img class="w-24 h-24 md:w-48 md:h-auto md:rounded-none rounded-full mx-auto" src="profile.png" />
  <p class="text-lg font-medium">“Tailwind CSS”</p>
</div>
```

## Bootstrap

**Important Documentation**: [Getting started with Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)

The reigning champion for CSS frameworks is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Bootstrap has been supported by an active and vibrant community for over a decade and contains many lessons learned from real world applications. The major downside of Bootstrap is its own success. Because it is so popular, Bootstrap defines the de facto look and feel of websites. This is great for user experience continuity, but it makes it difficult for a website to grab the attention of new users.

### Getting bootstrap

You can integrate Bootstrap into your web applications simply by referencing the Bootstrap CSS files from their [content delivery network](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/#cdn-links) (CDN). You then add the HTML link elements to your head element like this.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

If you are going to use Bootstrap components that require JavaScript (carousel, buttons, and more), you will also need to include Bootstrap's JavaScript module. You add this by putting the following at **the end** of your HTML body element.

```html
<body>
  ...

  <script
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
</body>
```


```sh
npm install bootstrap@5.2.3
```

### Using bootstrap

Once you have Bootstrap linked in your HTML files you can begin using the components it provides. Let's start with a simple button. When we use the Bootstrap `btn` CSS class, the button gets a nice looking rounded appearance. The Bootstrap `btn-primary` CSS class shades the button with the current primary color for the application, which by default is blue. The following demonstrates the difference between a Bootstrap style button and a plain vanilla button. Functionally they both work exactly the same. The Bootstrap button is just a lot easier on the eyes.

```html
// Bootstrap styled button
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Bootstrap</button>

// Default browser styled button
<button type="button">Plain</button>
```

# Javascript

## Basic Functionality

Let's start with a basic example. The following JavaScript will concatenate three strings together and then throw away the result. Not very useful, but JavaScript doesn't complain much.

```js
'Hello' + ' ' + 'world';
```

Only slightly more complex is to call a function with the result of our concatenated string. In this case we call the JavaScript runtime's built in function `console.log` to output the string to the debugger console.

```js
console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'world');
// OUTPUT: Hello world
```

You can also write your own functions.

```js
function join(a, b) {
  return a + ' ' + b;
}

console.log(join('Hello', 'world'));
// OUTPUT: Hello world
```

## Comments

You can comment your JavaScript with either line or block comments.

```js
// Line comment

/*
Block comment
*/
```

## Code delimiters

While not technically required in most cases, it is considered good form to end JavaScript statements with a semicolon (`;`). Code blocks, and their resulting scope, are defined with curly braces (`{ }`).

# Console Commands in Javascript

## Log

The basic usage of the console object is to output a log message.

```js
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
```

You can create formatted messages in the log parameter.

```js
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

You can even specify CSS declarations in order to style the log output.

```js
console.log('%c JavaScript Demo', 'font-size:1.5em; color:green;');
// OUTPUT: JavaScript Demo //in large green text
```

## Timers

If you are trying to see how long a piece of code is running you can wrap it with `time` and `timeEnd` calls and it will output the duration between the `time` and `timeEnd` calls.

```js
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
```

## Count

To see how many times a block of code is called you can use the `count` function.

```js
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2
console.count('b');
// OUTPUT: b: 1
```
# Adding JavaScript to HTML

You can insert JavaScript into HTML either by directly including it in the HTML within the content of a `<script>` element, or by using the `src` attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.

**index.js**

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

**index.html**

```html
<head>
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello</button>
  <button onclick="sayGoodbye()">Say Goodbye</button>
  <script>
    function sayGoodbye() {
      alert('Goodbye');
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

Notice that we call the `sayHello` and `sayGoodbye` JavaScript functions from the HTML in the `onclick` attribute of the button element. Special attributes like `onclick` automatically create event listeners for different DOM events that call the code contained in the attribute's value. The code specified by the attribute value can be a simple call to a function or any JavaScript code.

```html
<button onclick="let i=1;i++;console.log(i)">press me</button>
<!-- OUTPUT: 2 -->
```

# Types, operators, and conditionals in Javascript

## Declaring variables

Variables are declared using either the `let` or `const` keyword. `let` allows you to change the value of the variable while `const` will cause an error if you attempt to change it.

```js
let x = 1;

const y = 2;
```

⚠ Originally JavaScript used the keyword `var` to define variables. This has been deprecated because they cause hard-to-detect errors in code related to the scope of the variable. You should avoid `var` and always declare your variables either with `let` or `const`.

## Type

JavaScript defines several primitive types.

| Type        | Meaning                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Null`      | The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value. |
| `Undefined` | The type of a variable that has not been defined.          |
| `Boolean`   | true or false.                                             |
| `Number`    | A 64-bit signed number.                                    |
| `BigInt`    | A number of arbitrary magnitude.                           |
| `String`    | A textual sequence of characters.                          |
| `Symbol`    | A unique value.                                            |

Of these types Boolean, Number, and String are the types commonly thought of when creating variables. However, variables may commonly refer to the Null or Undefined primitive. Because JavaScript does not enforce the declaration of a variable before you use it, it is entirely possible for a variable to have the type of Undefined.

In addition to the above primitives, JavaScript defines several object types. Some of the more commonly used objects include the following:

| Type       | Use                                                                                    | Example                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Object`   | A collection of properties represented by name-value pairs. Values can be of any type. | `{a:3, b:'fish'}`        |
| `Function` | An object that has the ability to be called.                                           | `function a() {}`        |
| `Date`     | Calendar dates and times.                                                              | `new Date('1995-12-17')` |
| `Array`    | An ordered sequence of any type.                                                       | `[3, 'fish']`            |
| `Map`      | A collection of key-value pairs that support efficient lookups.                        | `new Map()`              |
| `JSON`     | A lightweight data-interchange format used to share information across programs.       | `{"a":3, "b":"fish"}`    |

## Common operators

When dealing with a number variable, JavaScript supports standard mathematical operators like `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), and `===` (equality). For string variables, JavaScript supports `+` (concatenation) and `===` (equality).

## Type conversions

JavaScript is a weakly typed language. That means that a variable always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value, or that types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in. Sometimes the results of automatic conversions can be unexpected from programmers who are used to strongly typed languages. Consider the following examples.

```js
2 + '3';
// OUTPUT: '23'
2 * '3';
// OUTPUT: 6
[2] + [3];
// OUTPUT: '23'
true + null;
// OUTPUT: 1
true + undefined;
// OUTPUT: NaN
```

Getting unexpected results is especially common when dealing with the [equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness) operator.

```js
1 == '1';
// OUTPUT: true
null == undefined;
// OUTPUT: true
'' == false;
// OUTPUT: true
```

⚠ The unexpected results happen in JavaScript because it uses [complex rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#strict_equality_using) for defining equality that depend upon the conversion of a type to a boolean value. You will sometimes hear this referred to as [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) and [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) evaluations. To remove this confusion, JavaScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators. The strict operators skip the type conversion when computing equality. This results in the following.

```js
1 === '1';
// OUTPUT: false
null === undefined;
// OUTPUT: false
'' === false;
// OUTPUT: false
```

Because strict equality is considered more intuitive, it is almost always preferred and should be used in your code.

Here is a fun example of JavaScript's type conversion. Execute the following in the browser's debugger console.

```js
('b' + 'a' + +'a' + 'a').toLowerCase();
```

## Conditionals

JavaScript supports many common programming language conditional constructs. This includes `if`, `else`, and `if else`. Here are some examples.

```js
if (a === 1) {
  //...
} else if (b === 2) {
  //...
} else {
  //...
}
```

You can also use the ternary operator. This provides a compact `if else` representation.

```js
a === 1 ? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
```

You can use boolean operations in the expression to create complex predicates. Common boolean operators include `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not).

```js
if (true && (!false || true)) {
  //...
}
```

### Loops

JavaScript supports many common programming language looping constructs. This includes `for`, `for in`, `for of`, `while`, `do while`, and `switch`. Here are some examples.

### for

Note the introduction of the common post increment operation (`i++`) for adding one to a number.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### do while

```js
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### while

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### for in

The `for in` statement iterates over an object's property names.

```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' };
for (const name in obj) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: a
// OUTPUT: b
```

For arrays the object's name is the array index.

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const name in arr) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: 0
// OUTPUT: 1
```

### for of

The `for of` statement iterates over an iterable's (Array, Map, Set, ...) property values.

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}
// OUTPUT: 'a'
// OUTPUT: 'b'
```

### Break and continue

All of the looping constructs demonstrated above allow for either a `break` or `continue` statement to abort or advance the loop.

```js
let i = 0;
while (true) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 0) {
    i++;
    continue;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

# Javascript Strings

Strings are a primitive type in JavaScript. A string variable is specified by surrounding a sequence of characters with single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``). The meaning of single or double quotes are equivalent, but the backtick defines a string literal that may contain JavaScript that is evaluated in place and concatenated into the string. A string literal replacement specifier is declared with a dollar sign followed by a curly brace pair. Anything inside the curly braces is evaluated as JavaScript. You can also use backticks to create multiline strings without having to explicitly escape the newline characters using `\n`.

```js
'quoted text'; // " also works

const l = 'literal';
console.log(`string ${l + (1 + 1)} text`);
// OUTPUT: string literal2 text
```

## Unicode support

JavaScript supports Unicode by defining a string as a 16-bit unsigned integer that represents UTF-16 strings. Unicode support allows JavaScript to represent most languages spoken on the planet. This includes those that are read from right to left.

However, there are several important steps you must take in order to make your web application fully internationalized. This includes handling of currency, time, dates, iconography, units of measure, keyboard layouts, and respecting local customs.

## String functions

The string object has several interesting functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

| Function      | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| length        | The number of characters in the string                       |
| indexOf()     | The starting index of a given substring                      |
| split()       | Split the string into an array on the given delimiter string |
| startsWith()  | True if the string has a given prefix                        |
| endsWith()    | True if the string has a given suffix                        |
| toLowerCase() | Converts all characters to lowercase                         |

```js
const s = 'Example:조선글';

console.log(s.length);
// OUTPUT: 11
console.log(s.indexOf('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: 8
console.log(s.split(':'));
// OUTPUT: ['Example', '조선글']
console.log(s.startsWith('Ex'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.endsWith('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.toLowerCase());
// OUTPUT: example:조선글
```

# Javascript Functions

In JavaScript functions are first class objects. That means that they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array just like any other variable.

The basic syntax of a function begins with the `function` keyword followed by zero or more parameters and a body that may contain zero or more return statements. The return statement may return a single value. Note that there are no type declarations, as the type is always inferred by the assignment of the value to the parameter.

```js
function hello(who) {
  return 'hello ' + who;
}

console.log(hello('world'));
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

A function without a return value usually exists to produce some side effect like modifying a parameter or interacting with an external program. In the following example the side effect of the function is to output text to the debugger console.

```js
function hello(who) {
  who.count++;
  console.log('hello ' + who.name);
}

hello({ name: 'world', count: 0 });
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

## Function parameters

When a function is called, the caller may choose what parameters to provide. If a parameter is not provided then the value of the parameter is `undefined` when the function executes.

In addition to explicitly passing the value of a parameter to a function, the function can define a default value. This is done by assigning a value to the parameter in the function declaration.

```js
function labeler(value, title = 'title') {
  console.log(`${title}=${value}`);
}

labeler();
// OUTPUT: title=undefined

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: title=fish

labeler('fish', 'animal');
// OUTPUT: animal=fish
```

## Anonymous functions

Functions in JavaScript are commonly assigned to a variable so that they can be passed as a parameter to some other function or stored as an object property. To easily support this common use you can define a function anonymously and assign it to a variable.

```js
// Function that takes a function as a parameter
function doMath(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8

// Anonymous function assigned to a parameter
console.log(
  doMath(
    function (a, b) {
      return a - b;
    },
    5,
    3
  )
);
// OUTPUT: 2
```

## Creating, passing, and returning functions

Here are examples of assigning functions to variables, as well as using functions as parameters and return values.

```js
// Anonymous declaration of the function that is later assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// Function that logs as a side effect of its execution
function labeler(label, value) {
  console.log(label + '=' + value);
}

// Function that takes a function as a parameter and then executes the function as a side effect
function addAndLabel(labeler, label, adder, a, b) {
  labeler(label, adder(a, b));
}

// Passing a function to a function
addAndLabel(labeler, 'a+b', add, 1, 3);
// OUTPUT: a+b=4

// Function that returns a function
function labelMaker(label) {
  return function (value) {
    console.log(label + '=' + value);
  };
}

// Assign a function from the return value of the function
const nameLabeler = labelMaker('name');

// Calling the returned function
nameLabeler('value');
// OUTPUT: name=value
```

## Inner functions

Functions can also be declared inside other functions. This allows you to modularize your code without always exposing private details.

```js
function labeler(value) {
  function stringLabeler(value) {
    console.log('string=' + value);
  }
  function numberLabeler(value) {
    console.log('number=' + value);
  }

  if (typeof value == 'string') {
    stringLabeler(value);
  } else if (typeof value == 'number') {
    numberLabeler(value);
  }
}

labeler(5);
// OUTPUT: number=5

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: string=fish
```

# JavaScript arrow function

Because functions are first order objects in JavaScript they can be declared anywhere and passed as parameters. This results in code with lots of anonymous functions cluttering things up. To make the code more compact the `arrow` syntax was created. This syntax replaces the need for the `function` keyword with the symbols `=>` placed after the parameter declaration. The enclosing curly braces are also optional.

This is a function in arrow syntax that takes no parameters and always returns 3.

```js
() => 3;
```

The following two invocations of sort are equivalent.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
```

Besides being compact, the `arrow` function syntax has some important semantic differences from the standard function syntax. This includes restrictions that arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators.

## Return values

Arrow functions also have special rules for the `return` keyword. The return keyword is optional if no curly braces are provided for the function and it contains a single expression. In that case the result of the expression is automatically returned. If curly braces are provided then the arrow function behaves just like a standard function.

```js
() => 3;
// RETURNS: 3

() => {
  3;
};
// RETURNS: undefined

() => {
  return 3;
};
// RETURNS: 3
```

## This pointer

Next, arrow functions inherit the `this` pointer from the scope of where it is created. This makes what is known as a `closure`. A closure allows a function to continue referencing its creation scope, even after it has passed out of that scope. This can be tricky to wrap your head around, and we discuss it in detail when we later talk about JavaScript `scope`. For now consider the following example.

The function `makeClosure` returns an anonymous function using the arrow syntax. Notice that the `a` parameter is overridden, a new `b` variable is created, and both `a` and `b` are referenced in the arrow function. Because of that reference, they are both part of the closure for the returned function.

```js
function makeClosure(a) {
  a = 'a2';
  const b = 'b2';
  return () => [a, b];
}
```

Next, we declare the variables `a` and `b` at the top level scope, and call `makeClosure` with `a`.

```js
const a = 'a';
const b = 'b';

const closure = makeClosure(a);
```

Now, when we call `closure` function it will output the values contained in scope where it was created instead of the current values of the variables.

```js
console.log(closure());
// OUTPUT: ['a2', 'b2']

console.log(a, b);
// OUTPUT: 'a' 'b'
```

Closures provide a valuable property when we do things like execute JavaScript within the scope of an HTML page, because it can remember the values of variables when the function was created instead of what they are when they are executed.

# JavaScript array

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

JavaScript array objects represent a sequence of other objects and primitives. You can reference the members of the array using a zero based index. You can create an array with the Array constructor or using the array literal notation shown below.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a[1]);
// OUTPUT: 2

console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 3
```

## Object functions

The Array object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the interesting ones.

| Function | Meaning                                                   | Example                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| push     | Add an item to the end of the array                       | `a.push(4)`                   |
| pop      | Remove an item from the end of the array                  | `x = a.pop()`                 |
| slice    | Return a sub-array                                        | `a.slice(1,-1)`               |
| sort     | Run a function to sort an array in place                  | `a.sort((a,b) => b-a)`        |
| values   | Creates an iterator for use with a `for of` loop          | `for (i of a.values()) {...}` |
| find     | Find the first item satisfied by a test function          | `a.find(i => i < 2)`          |
| forEach  | Run a function on each array item                         | `a.forEach(console.log)`      |
| reduce   | Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item | `a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)`   |
| map      | Run a function to map an array to a new array             | `a.map(i => i+i)`             |
| filter   | Run a function to remove items                            | `a.filter(i => i%2)`          |
| every    | Run a function to test if all items match                 | `a.every(i => i < 3)`         |
| some     | Run a function to test if any items match                 | `a.some(i => 1 < 1)`          |

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a.map((i) => i + i));
// OUTPUT: [2,4,6]
console.log(a.reduce((v1, v2) => v1 + v2));
// OUTPUT: 6
console.log(a.sort((v1, v2) => v2 - v1));
// OUTPUT: [3,2,1]

a.push(4);
console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 4

JSON provides a simple, and yet effective way, to share and store data. By design JSON is easily convertible to, and from, JavaScript objects. This make it a very convenient data format when working with web technologies. Because of its simplicity, standardization, and compatibility with JavaScript, JSON has become one of the world's most popular data formats.

### Format

A JSON document contains one of the following data types:

| Type    | Example                 |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| string  | "crockford"             |
| number  | 42                      |
| boolean | true                    |
| array   | [null,42,"crockford"]   |
| object  | {"a":1,"b":"crockford"} |
| null    | null                    |

# JSON

Most commonly, a JSON document contains an object. Objects contain zero or more key value pairs. The key is always a string, and the value must be one of the valid JSON data types. Key value pairs are delimited with commas. Curly braces delimit an object, square brackets and commas delimit arrays, and strings are always delimited with double quotes.

Here is an example of a JSON document.

```json
{
  "class": {
    "title": "web programming",
    "description": "Amazing"
  },
  "enrollment": ["Marco", "Jana", "فَاطِمَة"],
  "start": "2025-02-01",
  "end": null
}
```

JSON is always encoded with [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). This allows for the representation of global data.

### Converting to JavaScript

You can convert JSON to, and from, JavaScript using the `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` functions.

```js
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj, json, objFromJson);

// OUTPUT:
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined}
// {"a":2, "b":"crockford"}
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford'}
```

Note that in this example, JSON cannot represent the JavaScript `undefined` object and so it gets dropped when converting from JavaScript to JSON.

# JavaScript regular expressions

Regular expression support is built right into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, you can think of them as textual pattern matchers. You use a regular expression to find text in a string so that you can replace it, or simply to know that it exists.

You can create a regular expression using the class constructor or a regular expression literal.

```js
const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```

The `string` class has several functions that accept regular expressions. This includes `match`, `replace`, `search`, and `split`. For a quick test to see if there is a match you can use the regular expression object's `test` function.

```js
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```
# JavaScript rest and spread
## Rest

Sometimes you want a function to take an unknown number of parameters. For example, if you wanted to write a function that checks to see if some number in a list is equal to a given number, you could write this using an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

const a = [1, 2, 3];
hasNumber(2, a);
// RETURNS: true
```

However sometimes you don't have an array to work with. In this case you could create one on the fly.

```js
function hasTwo(a, b, c) {
  return hasNumber(2, [a, b, c]);
}
```

But JavaScript provides the `rest` syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the `rest` of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a `rest` parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```

Note that you can only make the last parameter a `rest` parameter. Otherwise JavaScript would not know which parameters to combine into the array.

Technically speaking, `rest` allows JavaScript to provide what is called variadic functions.

## Spread

Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

```js
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

# JavaScript exceptions

JavaScript supports exception handling using the `try catch` and `throw` syntax. An exception can be triggered whenever your code generates an exception using the `throw` keyword, or whenever an exception is generated by the JavaScript runtime, for example, when an undefined variable is used.

To catch a thrown exception, you wrap a code block with the `try` keyword, and follow the try block with a `catch` block. If within the try block, including any functions that block calls, an exception is thrown, then all of the code after the throw is ignored, the call stack is unwound, and the catch block is called.

In addition to a catch block, you can specify a `finally` block that is always called whenever the `try` block is exited regardless if an exception was ever thrown.

The basic syntax looks like the following.

```js
try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
```

For example:

```js
function connectDatabase() {
  throw new Error('connection error');
}

try {
  connectDatabase();
  console.log('never executed');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
} finally {
  console.log('always executed');
}

// OUTPUT: Error: connection error
//         always executed
```

⚠ When first using exception handling it is tempting to use it as way to handle normal flows of execution. For example, throwing a `file not found` exception when it is common for users to request nonexistent files. Throwing exceptions should only happen when something truly exceptional occurs. For example, a `file not found` exception when the file is required for your code to run, such as a required configuration file. Your code will be easier to debug, and your logs more meaningful if you restrict exceptions to truly exceptional situations.

## Fallbacks

The fallback pattern is commonly implemented using exception handling. To implement the fallback pattern you put the normal feature path in a try block and then provide a fallback implementation in the catch block. For example, normally you would get the high scores for a game by making a network request, but if the network is not available then a locally cached version of the last available scores is used. By providing a fallback, you can always return something, even if the desired feature is temporarily unavailable.

```js
function getScores() {
  try {
    const scores = scoringService.getScores();
    // store the scores so that we can use them later if the network is not available
    window.localStorage.setItem('scores', scores);
    return scores;
  } catch {
    return window.localStorage.getItem('scores');
  }
}
```
# JavaScript destructuring

Destructuring, not to be confused with destructing, is the process of pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure. You can do this with either arrays or objects. This is helpful when you only care about a few items in the original structure.

An example of destructuring arrays looks like the following.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
```

Note that even though it looks like you are declaring an array with the syntax on the left side of the expression, it is only specifying that you want to destructure those values out of the array.

You can also combine multiple items from the original object using rest syntax.

```js
const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
```

This works in a similar manner for objects, except with arrays, the assignment of the associated value was assumed by the positions in the two arrays. When destructuring objects, you explicitly specify the properties you want to pull from the source object.

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a, c } = o;

console.log(a, c);
// OUTPUT 1, ['fish', 'cats']
```

You can also map the names to new variables instead of just using the original property names.

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a: count, b: type } = o;

console.log(count, type);
// OUTPUT 1, animals
```

Default values may also be provided for missing ones.

```js
const { a, b = 22 } = {};
const [c = 44] = [];

console.log(a, b, c);
// OUTPUT: undefined, 22, 44
```

Note that all of the above examples created new constant variables, but you can also use destructuring to reassign existing variables.

```js
let a = 22;

[a] = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a);
// OUTPUT: 1
```
# JavaScript object and classes

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Classes in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript)

A JavaScript object represents a collection of name value pairs referred to as properties. The property name must be of type String or Symbol, but the value can be of any type. Objects also have common object-oriented functionality such as constructors, a `this` pointer, static properties and functions, and inheritance.

Objects can be created with the new operator. This causes the object's constructor to be called. Once declared you can add properties to the object by simply referencing the property name in an assignment. Any type of variable can be assigned to a property. This includes a sub-object, array, or function. The properties of an object can be referenced either with dot (`obj.prop`) or bracket notation (`obj['prop']`).

```js
const obj = new Object({a:3});
obj['b'] = 'fish';
obj.c = [1, 2, 3];
obj.hello = function () {
  console.log('hello');
};

console.log(obj);
// OUTPUT: {a: 3, b: 'fish', c: [1,2,3], hello: func}
```

The ability to dynamically modify an object is incredibly useful when manipulating data with an indeterminate structure.

⚠ Note the different uses of the term `object`. Object can refer to the standard JavaScript objects (e.g. `Promise, Map, Object, Function, Date, ...`), or it can refer specifically to the JavaScript Object object (i.e. `new Object()`), or it can refer to any JavaScript object you create (e.g. `{a:'a', b:2}` ). This overloaded usage can be a bit confusing.

## Object-literals

You can also declare a variable of object type with the `object-literal` syntax. This syntax allows you to provide the initial composition of the object.

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};
```

## Object functions

Object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

| Function | Meaning                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| entries  | Returns an array of key value pairs |
| keys     | Returns an array of keys            |
| values   | Returns an array of values          |

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
// OUTPUT: [['a', 3], ['b', 'fish']]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.values(obj));
// OUTPUT: [3, 'fish']
```

## Constructor

Any function that returns an object is considered a `constructor` and can be invoked with the `new` operator.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {name: 'Eich'}
```

Because objects can have any type of property value you can create methods on the object as part of its encapsulation.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

## This pointer

Notice in the last example the use of the keyword `this` when we referred to the name property (`this.name`). The meaning of `this` depends upon the scope of where it is used, but in the context of an object it refers to a pointer to the object. We will talk more about the `this` pointer in the instruction on scope.

## Classes

You can use classes to define objects. Using a class clarifies the intent to create a reusable component rather than a one-off object. Class declarations look similar to declaring an object, but classes have an explicit constructor and assumed function declarations. The person object from above would look like the following when converted to a class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

You can make properties and functions of classes private by prefixing them with a `#`.

```js
class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.#name = 'Lie';
// OUTPUT: Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

## Inheritance

Classes can be extended by using the `extends` keyword to define inheritance. Parameters that need to be passed to the parent class are delivered using the `super` function. Any functions defined on the child that have the same name as the parent override the parent's implementation. A parent's function can be explicitly accessed using the `super` keyword.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  print() {
    return 'My name is ' + this.name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name);
    this.position = position;
  }

  print() {
    return super.print() + '. I am a ' + this.position;
  }
}

const e = new Employee('Eich', 'programmer');
console.log(e.print());
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich. I am a programmer
```

# Scope

Understanding JavaScript scope is essential for making your programs run as you expect. Scope is defined as the variables that are visible in the current context of execution. JavaScript has four different types of scope:

1. **Global** - Visible to all code
1. **Module** - Visible to all code running in a module
1. **Function** - Visible within a function
1. **Block** - Visible within a block of code delimited by curly braces

## Var

Initially JavaScript used the keyword `var` to declare a variable. The problem with var, unlike `const` or `let`, is that it ignores block scope. Variables declared with `var` are always logically hoisted to the top of the function. For example, the following code shows the same variable name being used within different enclosing scopes. However, because var ignores block scope the for loop is simply assigning a new value to `x` rather than declaring a new variable that has the same name.

```js
var x = 10;
console.log('start', x);

for (var x = 0; x < 1; x++) {
  console.log('middle', x);
}

console.log('end', x);

// OUTPUT: start 10
//         middle 0
//         end 1
```

⚠ There are few cases where it makes sense to use `var`. It is strongly suggested that you only use `const` and `let` unless you fully understand why you are using `var`.

## This

The keyword `this` represents a variable that points to an object that contains the context within the scope of the currently executing line of code. The `this` variable is automatically declared and you can reference `this` anywhere in a JavaScript program. Because the value of `this` depends upon the context in which it is referenced, there are three different context that this can refer to:

1. **Global** - When `this` is referenced outside a function or object it refers to the `globalThis` object. The globalThis object represents the context for runtime environment. For example, when running in a browser, globalThis refers to the browser's window object.
1. **Function** - When `this` is referenced in a function it refers to the object that owns the function. That is either an object you defined or globalThis if the function is defined outside of an object. Note that when running in JavaScript strict mode, a global function's this variable is undefined instead of globalThis.
1. **Object** - When `this` is referenced in an object it refers to the object.

```js
'use strict';

// global scope
console.log('global:', this);
console.log('globalThis:', globalThis);

// function scope for a global function
function globalFunc() {
  console.log('globalFunctionThis:', this);
}
globalFunc();

// object scope
class ScopeTest {
  constructor() {
    console.log('objectThis:', this);
  }

  // function scope for an object function
  objectFunc() {
    console.log('objectFunctionThis:', this);
  }
}

new ScopeTest().objectFunc();
```

Running the above code in a browser results in the following.

```
global: Window
globalThis: Window
globalFunctionThis: undefined
objectThis: ScopeTest
objectFunctionThis: ScopeTest
```

Note that if we were not using JavaScript strict mode then globalFunctionThis would refer to Window.

## Closure

A closure is defined as a function and its surrounding state. That means whatever variables are accessible when a function is created are available inside that function. This holds true even if you pass the function outside of the scope of its original creation.

Here is an example of a function that is created as part of an object. That means that function has access to the object's `this` pointer.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  f: function () {
    console.log(this.x);
  },
};

obj.f();
// OUTPUT: object
```

Arrow functions are a bit different because they inherit the `this` pointer of their creation context. So if we change our previous example to return an arrow function, then the `this` pointer at the time of creation will be globalThis.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  f: () => console.log(this.x),
};

obj.f();
// OUTPUT: global
```

However, if we make function in our object that **returns** an arrow function, then the `this` pointer will be the object's `this` pointer since that was the active context at the time the arrow function was created.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  make: function () {
    return () => console.log(this.x);
  },
};

const f = obj.make();
f();
// OUTPUT: object
```

# JavaScript modules

JavaScript modules allow for the partitioning and sharing of code. Initially JavaScript had no support for modules. Node.js, a server side JavaScript execution application, introduced the concept of modules in order to support the importing of packages of JavaScript from third party providers.

JavaScript got full module support with ES6, and they have become the standard module representation as [browser support](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import) for ES modules is now almost universal.

In order to differentiate between the two implementations, Node.js modules are called CommonJS modules, and JavaScript modules are called ES modules. For this discussion, we will focus only on ES modules.

Because modules create a file-based scope for the code they represent, you must explicitly `export` the objects from one file and then `import` them into another file. For example, here is a simple module that exports a function that displays an alert.

**alert.js**

```js
export function alertDisplay(msg) {
  alert(msg);
}
```

You can import the module's exported function into another module using the `import` keyword.

**main.js**

```js
import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';

alertDisplay('called from main.js');
```

## ES Modules in the browser

When you use ES modules in the browser via HTML script references, things get a little complicated. The key thing to understand is that modules can only be called from other modules. You cannot access JavaScript contained in a module from the global scope that your non-module JavaScript is executing in.

From your HTML, you can specify that you are using an ES module by including a `type` attribute with the value of `module` in the `script` element. You can then import and use other modules. This is shown in the example below.

**index.html**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
  alertDisplay('module loaded');
</script>
```

If we want to use a module in the global scope that our HTML or other non-module JavaScript is executing in, then we must leak it into the global scope. We do this by either attaching an event handler or explicitly adding a function to the global window object. In the example below, we expose the `alertDisplay` imported module function by attaching it to the global JavaScript `window` object so that it can then be called from the button `onclick` handler. We also expose the module function by attaching a `keypress` event.

**index.html**

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
      window.btnClick = alertDisplay;

      document.body.addEventListener('keypress', function (event) {
        alertDisplay('Key pressed');
      });
    </script>
    <button onclick="btnClick('button clicked')">Press me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, if the button is pushed or a key is pressed our ES module function will be called.

## Modules with web frameworks

Fortunately, when you use a web framework bundler, discussed in later instruction, to generate your web application distribution code, you usually don't have to worry about differentiating between global scope and ES module scope. The bundler will inject all the necessary syntax to connect your HTML to your modules. Historically, this was done by removing the modules and placing all of the JavaScript in a namespaced global partition. Now that ES Modules are supported on most browsers, the bundler will expose the ES module directly.

Because of the complex history of modules they can be a confusing topic, but it is well worth the time to understand how they work as they are a core piece of a web programmer's toolkit.

# Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object representation of the HTML elements that the browser uses to render the display. The browser also exposes the DOM to external code so that you can write programs that dynamically manipulate the HTML.

The browser provides access to the DOM through a global variable name `document` that points to the root element of the DOM. If you open the browser's debugger console window and type the variable name `document` you will see the DOM for the document the browser is currently rendering.

```html
> document

<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <p>text1 <span>text2</span></p>
    <p>text3</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

For everything in an HTML document there is a node in the DOM. This includes elements, attributes, text, comments, and whitespace. All of these nodes form a big tree, with the document node at the top.

<img src="dom.jpg"/>

## Accessing the DOM

Every element in an HTML document implements the DOM Element interface, which is derived from the DOM Node interface. The [DOM Element Interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) provides the means for iterating child elements, accessing the parent element, and manipulating the element's attributes. From your JavaScript code, you can start with the `document` variable and walk through the every element in the tree.

```js
function displayElement(el) {
  console.log(el.tagName);
  for (const child of el.children) {
    displayElement(child);
  }
}

displayElement(document);
```

You can provide a CSS selector to the `querySelectorAll` function in order to select elements from the document. The `textContent` property contains all of the element's text. You can even access a textual representation of an element's HTML content with the `innerHTML` property.

```js
const listElements = document.querySelectorAll('p');
for (const el of listElements) {
  console.log(el.textContent);
}
```

## Modifying the DOM

The DOM supports the ability to insert, modify, or delete the elements in the DOM. To create a new element you first create the element on the DOM document. You then insert the new element into the DOM tree by appending it to an existing element in the tree.

```js
function insertChild(parentSelector, text) {
  const newChild = document.createElement('div');
  newChild.textContent = text;

  const parentElement = document.querySelector(parentSelector);
  parentElement.appendChild(newChild);
}

insertChild('#courses', 'new course');
```

To delete elements call the `removeChild` function on the parent element.

```js
function deleteElement(elementSelector) {
  const el = document.querySelector(elementSelector);
  el.parentElement.removeChild(el);
}

deleteElement('#courses div');
```
The getElementById() method returns an element with a specified value.

The getElementById() method returns null if the element does not exist.

The getElementById() method is one of the most common methods in the HTML DOM. It is used almost every time you want to read or edit an HTML element.

## Injecting HTML

The DOM also allows you to inject entire blocks of HTML into an element. The following code finds the first `div` element in the DOM and replaces all the HTML it contains.

```js
const el = document.querySelector('div');
el.innerHTML = '<div class="injected"><b>Hello</b>!</div>';
```

However, directly injecting HTML as a block of text is a common attack vector for hackers. If an untrusted party can inject JavaScript anywhere in your application then that JavaScript can represent itself as the current user of the application. The attacker can then make requests for sensitive data, monitor activity, and steal credentials. The example below shows how the img element can be used to launch an attack as soon as the page is loaded.

```html
<img src="bogus.png" onerror="console.log('All your base are belong to us')" />
```

If you are injecting HTML, make sure that it cannot be manipulated by a user. Common injection paths include HTML input controls, URL parameters, and HTTP headers. Either sanitize any HTML that contains variables, or simply use DOM manipulation functions instead of using `innerHTML`.

## Event Listeners

All DOM elements support the ability to attach a function that gets called when an event occurs on the element. These functions are called [event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). Here is an example of an event listener that gets called when an element gets clicked.

```js
const submitDataEl = document.querySelector('#submitData');
submitDataEl.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.type);
});
```

There are lots of possible events that you can add a listener to. This includes things like mouse, keyboard, scrolling, animation, video, audio, WebSocket, and clipboard events. You can see the full list on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events). Here are a few of the more commonly used events.

| Event Category | Description           |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Clipboard      | Cut, copied, pasted   |
| Focus          | An element gets focus |
| Keyboard       | Keys are pressed      |
| Mouse          | Click events          |
| Text selection | When text is selected |

You can also add event listeners directly in the HTML. For example, here is a `onclick` handler that is attached to a button.

```html
<button onclick='alert("clicked")'>click me</button>
```

# Local storage
The browser's `localStorage` API provides the ability to persistently store and retrieve data (i.e. scores, usernames, etc.,) on a user's browser across user sessions and HTML page renderings. For example, your frontend JavaScript code could store a user's name on one HTML page, and then retrieve the name later when a different HTML page is loaded. The user's name will also be available in local storage the next time the same browser is used to access the same website.

In addition to persisting application data between page renderings, `localStorage` is also used as a cache for when data cannot be obtained from the server. For example, your frontend JavaScript could store the last high scores obtained from the service, and then display those scores in the future if the service is not available.

## How to use LocalStorage
There are four main functions that can be used with localStorage.

| Function             | Meaning                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| setItem(name, value) | Sets a named item's value into local storage |
| getItem(name)        | Gets a named item's value from local storage |
| removeItem(name)     | Removes a named item from local storage      |
| clear()              | Clears all items in local storage            |

A local storage value must be of type `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. If you want to store a JavaScript object or array, then you must first convert it to a JSON string with `JSON.stringify()` on insertion, and parse it back to JavaScript with `JSON.parse()` when retrieved.

## Example

Open your startup website and run the following code in the browser's dev tools console window.

```js
let user = 'Alice';

let myObject = {
  name: 'Bob',
  info: {
    favoriteClass: 'CS 260',
    likesCS: true,
  },
};

let myArray = [1, 'One', true];

localStorage.setItem('user', user);
localStorage.setItem('object', JSON.stringify(myObject));
localStorage.setItem('array', JSON.stringify(myArray));

console.log(localStorage.getItem('user'));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('object')));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('array')));
```

**Output**

```sh
Alice
{name: 'Bob', info: {favoriteClass: 'CS 260', likesCS: true}
[1, 'One', true]
```

Notice that you are able to see the round trip journey of the local storage values in the console output. If you want to see what values are currently set for your application, then open the `Application` tab of the dev tools and select `Storage > Local Storage` and then your domain name. With the dev tools you can add, view, update, and delete any local storage values.

# Promises

JavaScript executes as a single threaded application. That means there is only ever one piece of code executing at the same time. However, the fact that it does not execute concurrently does not mean that it does not execute in parallel. You can asynchronously execute code with the use of a JavaScript `Promise`. Because the execution is asynchronous the promise object can be in one of three states at any given point in time.

1. **pending** - Currently running asynchronously
1. **fulfilled** - Completed successfully
1. **rejected** - Failed to complete

You create a promise by calling the Promise object constructor and passing it an executor function that runs the asynchronous operation. Executing asynchronously means that promise constructor may return before the promise executor function runs.

We can demonstrate asynchronous execution by using the standard JavaScript `setTimeout` function to create a delay in the execution of the code. The setTimeout function takes the number of milliseconds to wait and a function to call after that amount of time has expired. We call the delay function in a for loop in the promise executor and also a for loop outside the promise so that both code blocks are running in parallel.

```js
const delay = (msg, wait) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(msg, wait);
  }, 1000 * wait);
};

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Code executing in the promise
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    delay('In promise', i);
  }
});

// Code executing after the promise
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  delay('After promise', i);
}

// OUTPUT:
//   In promise 0
//   After promise 0
//   In promise 1
//   After promise 1
//   In promise 2
//   After promise 2
```

## Resolving and rejecting

Now that we know how to use a promise to execute asynchronously, we need to be able to set the state to `fulfilled` when things complete correctly, or to `rejected` when an error happens. The promise executor function takes two functions as parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. Calling `resolve` sets the promise to the `fulfilled` state, and calling `reject` sets the promise to the `rejected` state.

Consider the following "coin toss" promise that waits ten seconds and then has a fifty percent chance of resolving or rejecting.

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
      resolve('success');
    } else {
      reject('error');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

If you log the coinToss promise object to the console immediately after calling the constructor, it will display that it is in the `pending` state.

```js
console.log(coinToss);
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}
```

If you then wait ten seconds and the log the coinToss promise object again, the state will either show as `fulfilled` or `rejected` depending upon the way the coin landed.

```js
console.log(coinToss);
// OUTPUT: Promise {<fulfilled>}
```

## Then, catch, finally

With the ability to asynchronously execute and set the resulting state, we now need a way to generically do something with the result of a promise after it resolves. This is done with functionality similar to exception handling. The promise object has three functions: `then`, `catch`, and `finally`. The `then` function is called if the promise is fulfilled, `catch` is called if the promise is `rejected`, and `finally` is always called after all the processing is completed.

We can rework our coinToss example and make it so 10 percent of the time the coin falls off the table and resolves to the rejected state. Otherwise the promise resolves to fulfilled with a result of either `heads` or `tails`.

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
      resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
    } else {
      reject('fell off table');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

We then chain the `then`, `catch` and `finally` functions to the coinToss object in order to handle each of the possible results.

```js
coinToss
  .then((result) => console.log(`Coin toss result: ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log('Toss completed'));

// OUTPUT:
//    Coin toss result: tails
//    Toss completed
```

## The observer pattern

Promises are the standard way to do asynchronous processing in JavaScript, but they are not the only way. The `Observer` pattern, popularized by web programming frameworks such as `Angular`, use a model called `Observer`. The major difference between Observers and Promises is that Promises immediately begin to execute when the Promise is created, but Observers form a pipeline that you then pass an execution object into. This allows Observers to be reused, and the result of executing an Observable to be saved as a history of a particular execution.

# JavaScript Async/await

JavaScript Promise objects are great for asynchronous execution, but as developers began to build large systems with promises they started wanting a more concise representation. This was provided with the introduction of the `async/await` syntax. The `await` keyword wraps the execution of a promise and removed the need to chain functions. The `await` expression will block until the promise state moves to `fulfilled`, or throws an exception if the state moves to `rejected`. For example, if we have a function that returns a coin toss promise.

```js
const coinToss = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
        resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
      } else {
        reject('fell off table');
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
};
```

We can create equivalent executions with either a promise `then/catch` chain, or an `await` with a `try/catch` block.

**then/catch chain version**

```js
coinToss()
  .then((result) => console.log(`Toss result ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log(`Toss completed`));
```

**async, try/catch version**

```js
try {
  const result = await coinToss();
  console.log(`Toss result ${result}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
} finally {
  console.log(`Toss completed`);
}
```

## async

One important restriction for working with `await` is that you cannot call await unless it is called at the top level of the JavaScript, or is in a function that is defined with the `async` keyword. Applying the `async` keyword transforms the function so that it returns a promise that will resolve to the value that was previously returned by the function. Basically this turns any function into an asynchronous function, so that it can in turn make asynchronous requests.

This can be demonstrated with a function that makes animal noises. Notice that the return value is a simple string.

```js
function cow() {
  return 'moo';
}
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: moo
```

If we designate the function to be asynchronous then the return value becomes a promise that is immediately resolved and has a value that is the return value of the function.

```js
async function cow() {
  return 'moo';
}
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<fulfilled>: 'moo'}
```

We then change the cow function to explicitly create a promise instead of the automatically generated promise that the await keyword generates.

```js
async function cow() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve('moo');
  });
}
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}
```

You can see that the promise is in the pending state because the promise's execution function has not yet resolved.

## await

The `async` keyword declares that a function returns a promise. The `await` keyword wraps a call to the `async` function, blocks execution until the promise has resolved, and then returns the result of the promise.

We can demonstrate `await` in action with the cow promise from above. If we log the output from invoking `cow` then we see that the return value is a promise. However, if we prefix the call to the function with the await keyword, execution will stop until the promise has resolved, at which point the result of the promise is returned instead of the actual promise object.

```js
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}

console.log(await cow());
// OUTPUT: moo
```

By combining `async`, to define functions that return promises, with `await`, to wait on the promise, you can create code that is asynchronous, but still maintains the flow of the code without explicitly using callbacks.

## Putting it all together

You can see the benefit for `async`/`await` clearly by considering a case where multiple promises are required. For example, when calling the `fetch` web API on an endpoint that returns JSON, you would need to resolve two promises. One for the network call, and one for converting the result to JSON. A promise implementation would look like the following.

```js
const httpPromise = fetch('https://simon.cs260.click/api/user/me');
const jsonPromise = httpPromise.then((r) => r.json());
jsonPromise.then((j) => console.log(j));
console.log('done');

// OUTPUT: done
// OUTPUT: {email: 'bud@mail.com', authenticated: true}
```

With async/await, you can clarify the code intent by hiding the promise syntax, and also make the execution block until the promise is resolved.

```js
const httpResponse = await fetch('https://simon.cs260.click/api/user/me');
const jsonResponse = await httpResponse.json();
console.log(jsonResponse));
console.log('done');

// OUTPUT: {email: 'bud@mail.com', authenticated: true}
// OUTPUT: done
```

# Debugging JavaScript

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)

It is inevitable that your code is going to have problems, or bugs, at some point. That may be while you are originally authoring it, working on other code that changes assumed dependencies, or while enhancing the code with new functionality.

Learning how to quickly discover, and resolve, bugs will greatly increase your value as a web developer. Additionally, debugging skills can also be used during the development process. By following a pattern of writing a block of code and then stepping through, or debugging, the block, you gain confidence that the block is working as desired before moving on to the next block.

## Console debugging

One of the simplest ways to debug your JavaScript code is to insert `console.log` functions that output the state of the code as it executes. For example, we can create a simple web application that has an HTML and JavaScript file that demonstrates the difference between `let` and `var`. By inserting `console.log` statements into the code, we can see what the value of each variable is as the code executes.

**index.html**

```html
<body>
  <h1>Debugging</h1>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
```

**index.js**

```js
var varCount = 20;
let letCount = 20;

console.log('Initial - var: %d, let: %d', varCount, letCount);

for (var varCount = 1; varCount < 2; varCount++) {
  for (let letCount = 1; letCount < 2; letCount++) {
    console.log('Loop - var: %d, let: %d', varCount, letCount);
  }
}

const h1El = document.querySelector('h1');
h1El.textContent = `Result - var:${varCount}, let:${letCount}`;
console.log('Final - var: %d, let: %d', varCount, letCount);
```

Take the following steps to see the result of console debugging.

1. Create the above files in a test directory named testConsole
1. Open the testConsole directory in VS Code
1. Run index.html using the VS Code Live Server extension
1. Open the Chrome browser debugger (press `F12`)
1. Select the `Console` tab
1. Refresh the browser

You should see the following result.

![JavaScript console debugging](javascriptDebugConsole.jpg)

You can use the debugger console window to inspect variables without using the `console.log` function from your code. For example, if you type varCount in the console window it will print out the current value of varCount. You can also execute JavaScript directly in the console window. For example, if you type `varCount = 50` and press `Enter` it will change the current value of varCount.

![JavaScript console debugging variables](javascriptDebugConsoleVars.jpg)

## Browser debugging

`console.log` debugging is great for times when you just need to quickly see what is going on in your code, but to really understand the code as it executes you want to use the full capabilities of the browser's debugger.

Using the same setup we used for `console.log` debugging, open up Chrome's browser debugger, but this time select the source tab. This will display the source files that comprise the currently rendered content.

![JavaScript source debugging](javascriptDebugSource.jpg)

You can either select `index.js` from the source view on the left, or press `CTRL-P` (on Windows) or `⌘-P` (on Mac) and then select `index.js` from the list that pops up. Then set a breakpoint on line 4 by clicking on the line number on the left of the displayed source code. This makes it so that the execution of code will pause whenever that line is executed. Refreshing the browser window will cause `index.js` to reload and pause on the breakpoint.

![JavaScript breakpoint](javascriptDebugBreakpoint.jpg)

With the browser paused in the debugger you can move your mouse cursor over a variable to see its value, see what variables are in scope, set watches on variables, or use the console to interact with the code.

This gives you complete control to inspect what the JavaScript code is doing and experiment with possible alternative directions for the code. Take some time to poke around in the debugger. Learning how to exploit its functionality will make you a much better web developer.

# Simon JavaScript

🎥 **Instruction video**: [Simon JavaScript](https://youtu.be/hqzXN-n2Q5I)

![Simon](../simon.png)

This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript for interactivity. This addition makes the application completely functional. The application has a login (home), game play, high scores, and about page. Each page contains a header that provides navigation between the pages, and a footer that references the source repository.

## Adding JavaScript

The major changes to the application include the introduction of `login.js`, `play.js`, and `scores.js`. When a user enters their login name, `login.js` puts that name in the browser's local storage so that it is available the next time they use the application. `play.js` controls all the game interactions and stores the resulting score in the browser's local storage. `scores.js` retrieves the high scores from local storage so that they can be displayed.

### index.html and login.js

The first place we used JavaScript in Simon, allows the user to provide their name. We then store that name in the Browser's local storage cache. Once in the cache we can read the value from other html pages, or even later browser sessions on the same device.

Notice the inclusion of a `onclick` call to the `login` function found in the `login.js` file. We reference the `login.js` file by including an HTML `script` element.

```html
<script src="login.js"></script>

//...

<input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Your name here" />
<button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="login()">Login</button>
```

In the `login.js` file we handle a click on the login button by using the document object's querySelector function to get the input element's value and store it in local storage. We then redirect the browser to display the `play.html` page.

```js
function login() {
  const nameEl = document.querySelector('#name');
  localStorage.setItem('userName', nameEl.value);
  window.location.href = 'play.html';
}
```

### scores.js

The `scores.js` reads the current high scores out of local storage and injects the values into the DOM usinng `createElement` and `appendChild` calls.

### play.js

This is where all the game play interactions occur. There are two classes one for `Button` and one for `Game`. The Button class handles the playing of the button's audio file, along with the change in color, when a button is pressed.

The Game class manages the current sequence that a user is supposed to duplicate. This is done with the `reset` function to clear out the sequence and add a new random button, and the `playSequence` function that plays the sequence for the user to duplicate.

## Study this code

Get familiar with what the example code teaches.

- Clone the repository to your development environment.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-javascript.git
  ```

- Review the code and get comfortable with everything it represents.
- View the code in your browser by hosting it using the VS Code Live Server extension.
- Make modifications to the code as desired. Experiment and see what happens.

## Deploy to production

- Deploy to your production environment using a copy of the `deployFiles.sh` script found in the [example class application](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-javascript/blob/main/deployFiles.sh). Take some time to understand how it works.

  ```sh
  ./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s simon
  ```

  For example,

  ```sh
  ./deployFiles.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon
  ```

# Console Commands

In Unix operating systems, the chmod command is used to change the access mode of a file. The name is an abbreviation of change mode.

'pwd' stands for 'Print Working Directory'. As the name states, command 'pwd' prints the current working directory or simply the directory user is, at present.

cd = change directory

ls = lists all the files and directories under a specified directory

ls flags:

-A	Lists all entries except . (dot) and .. (dot-dot).

-a	Lists all entries in the directory, including the entries that begin with a . (dot).

-b	Displays nonprintable characters in an octal (\nnn) notation.

-c	Uses the time of last modification of the i-node for either sorting (when used with the -t flag) or for displaying (when used with the -l flag). This flag must be used with either the -t or -l flag, or both.

-C	Sorts output vertically in a multicolumn format. This is the default method when output is to a terminal.

-d	Displays only the information for the directory named. Directories are treated like files, which is helpful when using the -l flag to get the status of a directory.

-e	Displays the mode (including security information), number of links, owner, group, size (in bytes), time of last modification, and name of each file. If the file is a special file, the size field contains the major and minor device numbers. If the file is a symbolic link, the path name of the linked-to file is printed preceded by a -> (minus, greater than) sign. The attributes of the symbolic link are displayed.

-f	Lists the name in each slot for each directory specified in the Directory parameter. This flag turns off the -l, -t, -s, and -r flags, and turns on the -a flag. The order of the listing is the order in which entries appear in the directory.

-F	Puts a / (slash) after each file name if the file is a directory, an * (asterisk) if the file can be executed, an = (equal sign) if the file is a socket, a | (pipe) sign if the file is a FIFO, and an @ for a symbolic link.
Note: Symbolic links are displayed with the trailing -> only if the -N flag is used or if the link points to a nonexistent file. Otherwise, information about the target file is displayed. You can also invoke this option by entering the ls -f command.

-g	Displays the same information as the -l flag, except the -g flag suppresses display of the owner and symbolic link information.

-i	Displays the i-node number in the first column of the report for each file.

-L	Lists the file or directory contents that the link references. This is the default action. Symbolic links are followed. If the -l option is used, the -N option becomes the default, and no symbolic links are followed. When the -l option is used, only the -L option can override the -N default.

-l	(Lower case L) Displays the mode, number of links, owner, group, size (in bytes), and time of last modification for each file. If the file is a special file, the size field contains the major and minor device numbers.
If the file is a symbolic link, the path name of the linked-to file is printed preceded by a ->. The attributes of the symbolic link are displayed. The -n, -g, and -o flag overrides the -l flag.

Notes:
A symbolically linked file is followed by an arrow and the contents of the symbolic link.
The performance of the ls command when used with the -l option can be improved by executing the mkpasswd command. This is helpful when a directory contains files owned by different users, such as the /tmp directory.

-m	Uses stream output format (a comma-separated series).

-n	Displays the same information as the -l flag, except that the -n flag displays the user and the group IDs instead of the user and group names.

-N	Does not follow symbolic links when determining the status of a file.

Note: If both the -L and -N options are used, the last one will dominate. Also, any time a symbolic link is given that includes a / (slash) as the final character, the link will automatically be followed regardless of any options used.

-o	Displays the same information as the -l flag, except the -o flag suppresses display of the group and symbolic link information.

-p	Puts a slash after each file name if that file is a directory. This is useful when you pipe the output of the ls command to the pr command, as follows:
ls  -p |  pr  -5  -t  -w80

-q	Displays nonprintable characters in file names as a ? (question mark).

-r	Reverses the order of the sort, giving reverse alphabetic or the oldest first, as appropriate.

-R	Lists all subdirectories recursively.

-s	Gives size in kilobytes (including indirect blocks) for each entry.

-t	Sorts by time of last modification (latest first) instead of by name.

-u	Uses the time of the last access, instead of the time of the last modification, for either sorting (when used with the -t flag) or for displaying (when used with the -l flag). This flag has no effect if it is not used with either the -t or -l flag, or both.

-x	Sorts output horizontally in a multicolumn format.

-1	Forces output into one-entry-per-line format. This is the default when the output is not directed to a terminal.

Vim commands:
h moves the cursor one character to the left.
j moves the cursor down one line.
k moves the cursor up one line.
l moves the cursor one character to the right.
0 moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
$ moves the cursor to the end of the line.
w move forward one word.
b move backward one word.
G move to the end of the file.
gg move to the beginning of the file.
`. move to the last edit.

mkdir:
Use the mkdir command to create one or more directories specified by the Directory parameter.

Each new directory contains the standard entries dot (.) and dot dot (..). You can specify the permissions for the new directories with the -m Mode flag.

When you create a directory, it is created within the current, or working, directory unless you specify an absolute path name to another location in the file system.

mv:
The mv command moves files and directories from one directory to another or renames a file or directory.

rm:
Use the rm command to remove files you no longer need.

man:
Stands for manual

Just about every program you have installed in your server comes with detailed documentation on how to use it properly. Reading man pages is a great way to unlock the power of your command line utilities, and, for some users, the man pages can be faster and more accurate than search engine results.

That being said, man pages can be very terse. This makes them ideal for advanced users, and perhaps intimidating for newer users. Nevertheless, newer Linux users should give them a try and see how they like it.

How to Read Man Pages on Command Line
Using man is as simple as opening your Terminal emulator, or logging into your server via SSH. Once there, you can simply type man followed by the program you want to learn about.

ssh:

The ssh command is used to securely log into a remote machine and execute commands on that machine. The basic syntax of the command is “ssh user@host”, where user is the username on the remote machine and host is the address or hostname of the remote machine.

ps:

ps command is used to list the currently running processes and their PIDs along with some other information depends on different options. It reads the process information from the virtual files in /proc file-system. /proc contains virtual files, this is the reason it's referred as a virtual file system.

wget:

Downloading files with wget is easy. Type wget followed by the file URL you wish to download to your command prompt app, and the download should begin after you press enter.

sudo:
To run commands with superuser privileges, use the sudo command. sudo stands for superuser do.

The sudo command allows you to run programs with the security privileges of another user (by default, as the superuser). It prompts you for your personal password and confirms your request to execute a command by checking a file, called sudoers , which the system administrator configures.

# Top Level domains, root domains, and sub domains:

What is the difference between Root domains and Subdomains?
The root domain name is your website’s main or primary domain. It is the simplest form of a domain name. It can stand alone, and it can also have one or more subdomains branching out from it.

On the other hand, a subdomain is like a subsection or a smaller part of the main website. A subdomain always belongs to a root domain. For example, careers.siteground.com is a subdomain of the base domain siteground.com.

Subdomains help organize website content and make it easier to navigate. They can also have their own individual pages or even separate websites with unique content, design, and functionality. You can access the root domain and all its subdomains through their own web addresses, and they all fall under the same main domain.

In short, the primary difference is that the root domain represents the main website (or company), while subdomains are separate sections or websites within the main domain.

What is the difference between Root domains and Top-Level domains (TLD)?
The root-level domain is like the main folder of a website, where all the other folders and files are stored. It is the topmost part of a website’s address and represents the ground level of the website’s identity. For example, in the website address “www.siteground.com,” “siteground.com” is the root domain.

In contrast, a top-level domain (TLD) is the suffix that follows the domain name, such as .com, .org, .edu, .gov, and so on. TLDs are also referred to as “domain extensions”. It is the last part of the website’s address and comes after the root domain.

An infographic explaining the difference between a root domain and TLDs
For example, in the website address “www.example.com,” “.com” is the top-level domain. Other examples of TLDs include “.org,” “.net,” “.edu,” and “.gov.”

The key difference between a top-level and a root domain is that a TLD is a part of the domain name system, whereas a root domain is a part of the web hosting system. In that sense, TLDs are used to classify and categorize websites, while root domains are used to organize and manage website content.

## Web certificate for https
To use HTTPS with your domain name, you need a SSL or TLS certificate installed on your website. Your web host (Web Hosting Provider) may offer HTTPS security or you can request a SSL/TLS certificate from Certificate Authorities and install it yourself. SSL/TLS certificates may need to be renewed periodically.

## DNS A records


In this article, we’ll focus on one fundamental type—the DNS A record. Read on to find out what a DNS A record is, and how to add, edit, and delete an A record on your DNS server.

What is a DNS “A” Record?
A DNS A record is the most fundamental type of DNS record. The A stands for “Address,” and it’s used to point a domain name to an IP address or host. You can only use an A record when you want to point to an IPv4 address. An AAAA record is required if you wish to direct your domain to an IPv6 address. 

The DNS A record points a domain name like google.com to the IP address of itsDNS hosting server, in this case, “74.125.224.147.” While most sites have a single A DNS record, it’s possible to have multiple records. 

Another vital aspect of a DNS A record is that you can use it (often with a CNAME record) to create a subdomain that also points to the same IP address, for instance, blog.example.com.


# Ports

What is a Port?
Generally, Port is used to make the computer understand what type of data is received from or sent to a computer over the similar network connection. Each Port is assigned with different functionality and a port number like Port 80, 443, 21, 25, etc. Port is a virtual numbered address used as an endpoint for communication to the various Transport Layer Protocols.

Transport Layer protocols include Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and are used in data transmission over the Internet.

UDP is mostly used for large volumes of data transfer where security is not of much significance, while TCP is used where data security is of prime importance. When data transfer occurs, each data pack comes with a port number attached to it, and the protocol directs each data pack to the appropriate Port with accuracy. According to the SMB vulnerability report, 65% of attacks target the main three ports: SSH- 22/TCP, HTTPS-443/TCP and HTTP-80/TCP.

Port 22
Secure Shell (SSH),[11] secure logins, file transfers (scp, sftp) and port forwarding

Port 80
HTTP Port-80 is used for HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) connection by default. It is a popular and widely used port across the globe. Port 80 was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 in the HTTP 0.9 document. The document states that if there is no port assigned for HTTP connection, Port 80 is used by default. It connects you to the worldwide web (WWW). A user, with the help of this port, can connect to webpages available on the internet. It means unencoded data exchange takes place between the user’s browser and the server using this port. This port relates to TCP (Transfer Control Protocol- a protocol used in data transmission).

Port 443
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secured HTTP version where all traffic is bind with strong encryption that passes through 443. This port is also connected with TCP protocol and creates a secure connection between the webpages and browser. HTTPS Port 443 was officially published in RFC 1700 and solicited by “Kipp E.B. Hickman”. The main difference between Port 80 and Port 443 is strong security. Port-443 allows data transmission over a secured network, while Port 80 enables data transmission in plain text. Users will get an insecure warning if he tries to access a non-HTTPS web page. Port 443 encrypts network data packets before data transmission takes place. The security over port 443 is used by the SSL protocol (secure socket layer).

# Web services introduction

Up to this point, your entire application is loaded from your web server and runs on the user's browser. It starts when the browser requests the `index.html` file from the web server. The `index.html`, in turn, references other HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image files. All of these files, that are running on the browser, comprise the `frontend` of your application.

Notice that when the frontend requests the application files from the web server it is using the HTTPS protocol. All web programming requests between devices use HTTPS to exchange data.

![Frontend](frontEnd.png)

From our frontend JavaScript we can make requests to external services running anywhere in the world. This allows us to get external data, such as an inspirational quote, that we then inject into the DOM for the user to read. To make a web service request, we supply the URL of the web service to the `fetch` function that is built into the browser.

![Frontend Fetch](frontEndFetch.png)

The next step in building a full stack web application, is to create our own web service. Our web service will provide the static frontend files along with functions to handle `fetch` requests for things like storing data persistently, providing security, running tasks, executing application logic that you don't want your user to be able to see, and communicating with other users. The functionality provided by your web service represents the `backend` of your application.

Generally the functions provided by a web service are called `endpoints`, or sometimes APIs. You access the web service endpoints from your frontend JavaScript with the fetch function. In the picture below, the backend web service is not only providing the static files that make up the frontend, but also providing the web service endpoints that the frontend calls to do things like get a user, create a user, or get high scores.

![Backend](backEnd.png)

The backend web service can also use `fetch` to make requests to other web services. For example, in the image below the frontend uses `fetch` to request the user's data from the backend web service. The backend then uses `fetch` to call two other web services, one to get the user's data from the database, and another one to request subway routes that are near the user's home. That data is then combined together by the backend web service and returned to the frontend for display in the browser.

![Backend](backEndFetch.png)

In following instruction we will discuss how to use fetch, HTTP, and URLs, and build a web service using the Node.js application. With all of this in place your application will be a full stack application comprised of both a frontend and a backend.

# URL


The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) represents the location of a web resource. A web resource can be anything, such as a web page, font, image, video stream, database record, or JSON object. It can also be completely ephemeral, such as a visitation counter, or gaming session.

Looking at the different parts of a URL is a good way to understand what it represents. Here is an example URL that represents the summary of accepted CS 260 BYU students that is accessible using secure HTTP.

```js
https://byu.edu:443/cs/260/student?filter=accepted#summary
```

The URL syntax uses the following convention. Notice the delimiting punctuation between the parts of the URL. Most parts of the URL are optional. The only ones that are required are the scheme, and the domain name.

```yaml
<scheme>://<domain name>:<port>/<path>?<parameters>#<anchor>
```

| Part        | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheme      | https                                | The protocol required to ask for the resource. For web applications, this is usually HTTPS. But it could be any internet protocol such as FTP or MAILTO.                                                                                                                            |
| Domain name | byu.edu                              | The domain name that owns the resource represented by the URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Port        | 3000                                 | The port specifies the numbered network port used to connect to the domain server. Lower number ports are reserved for common internet protocols, higher number ports can be used for any purpose. The default port is 80 if the scheme is HTTP, or 443 if the scheme is HTTPS.     |
| Path        | /school/byu/user/8014                | The path to the resource on the domain. The resource does not have to physically be located on the file system with this path. It can be a logical path representing endpoint parameters, a database table, or an object schema.                                                    |
| Parameters  | filter=names&highlight=intro,summary | The parameters represent a list of key value pairs. Usually it provides additional qualifiers on the resource represented by the path. This might be a filter on the returned resource or how to highlight the resource. The parameters are also sometimes called the query string. |
| Anchor      | summary                              | The anchor usually represents a sub-location in the resource. For HTML pages this represents a request for the browser to automatically scroll to the element with an ID that matches the anchor. The anchor is also sometimes called the hash, or fragment ID.                     |

Technically you can also provide a user name and password before the domain name. This was used historically to authenticate access, but for security reasons this is deprecated. However, you will still see this convention for URLs that represent database connection strings.

## URL, URN, and URI

You will sometimes hear the use of URN or URI when talking about web resources. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a unique resource name that does not specify location information. For example, a book URN might be `urn:isbn:10,0765350386`. A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a general resource identifier that could refer to either a URL or a URN. With web programming you are almost always talking about URLs and therefore you should not use the more general URI.

# Ports

When you connect to a device on the internet you need both an IP address and a numbered port. Port numbers allow a single device to support multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or SSH) as well as different types of services (e.g. search, document, or authentication). The ports may be exposed externally, or they may only be used internally on the device. For example, the HTTPS port (443) might allow the world to connect, the SSH port (22) might only allow computers at your school, and a service defined port (say 3000) may only allow access to processes running on the device.

The internet governing body, IANA, defines the standard usage for port numbers. Ports from 0 to 1023 represent standard protocols. Generally a web service should avoid these ports unless it is providing the protocol represented by the standard. Ports from 1024 to 49151 represent ports that have been assigned to requesting entities. However, it is very common for these ports to be used by services running internally on a device. Ports from 49152 to 65535 are considered dynamic and are used to create dynamic connections to a device. [Here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) is the link to IANA's registry.

Here is a list of common port numbers that you might come across.

| Port | Protocol                                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20   | File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer                                                     |
| 22   | Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices                                                |
| 25   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email                                             |
| 53   | Domain Name System (DNS) for looking up IP addresses                                               |
| 80   | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web requests                                                |
| 110  | Post Office Protocol (POP3) for retrieving email                                                   |
| 123  | Network Time Protocol (NTP) for managing time                                                      |
| 161  | Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers |
| 194  | Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting                                                             |
| 443  | HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests                                                        |

## Your ports

As an example of how ports are used we can look at your web server. When you built your web server you externally exposed port 22 so that you could use SSH to open a remote console on the server, port 443 for secure HTTP communication, and port 80 for unsecure HTTP communication.

![Ports](webServicesPorts.jpg)

Your web service, Caddy, is listening on ports 80 and 443. When Caddy gets a request on port 80, it automatically redirects the request to port 443 so that a secure connection is used. When Caddy gets a request on port 443 it examines the path provided in the HTTP request (as defined by the URL) and if the path matches a static file, it reads the file off disk and returns it. If the HTTP path matches one of the definitions it has for a gateway service, Caddy makes a connection on that service's port (e.g. 3000 or 4000) and passes the request to the service.

Internally on your web server, you can have as many web services running as you would like. However, you must make sure that each one uses a different port to communicate on. You run your Simon service on port 3000 and therefore **cannot** use port 3000 for your startup service. Instead you use port 4000 for your startup service. It does not matter what high range port you use. It only matters that you are consistent and that they are only used by one service.

# HTTP

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (`HTTP`) is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language makes a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web.

When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response. You can see the HTTP exchange by using the browser's debugger or by using a console tool like `curl`. For example, in your console you can use `curl` to make the following request.

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

### Request

The HTTP request for the above command would look like the following.

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

```yaml
<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

The first line of the HTTP request contains the `verb` of the request, followed by the path, parameters, and anchor of the URL, and finally the version of HTTP being used. The following lines are optional headers that are defined by key value pairs. After the headers you have an optional body. The body start is delimited from the headers with two new lines.

In the above example, we are asking to `GET` a resource found at the path `/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html`. The version used by the request is `HTTP/1.1`. This is followed by two headers. The first specifies the requested host (i.e. domain name). The second specifies what type of resources the client will accept. The resource type is always a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) as defined by internet governing body IANA. In this case we are asking for HTML.

### Response

The response to the above request looks like this.

```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:54:42 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 29 Oct 1992 11:15:20 GMT
ETag: "5f0-28f29422b8200"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1520
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<TITLE>Helping -- /WWW</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>How can I help?</H1>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing
the <A NAME=4 HREF=TheProject.html>web</A> grow and be even more useful...
```

An HTTP response has the following syntax.

```yaml
<version> <status code> <status string>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

You can see that the response syntax is similar to the request syntax. The major difference is that the first line represents the version and the status of the response.

Understanding the meaning of the common HTTP verbs, status codes, and headers is important for you to understand, as you will use them in developing a web application. Take some time to internalize the following common values.

## Verbs

There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

## Status codes

It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks.

- 1xx - Informational.
- 2xx - Success.
- 3xx - Redirect to some other location, or that the previously cached resource is still valid.
- 4xx - Client errors. The request is invalid.
- 5xx - Server errors. The request cannot be satisfied due to an error on the server.

Within those ranges here are some of the more common codes. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for a full description of status codes.

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

## Headers

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

| Header                      | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Body

The format of the body of an HTTP request or response is defined by the `Content-Type` header. For example, it may be HTML text (text/html), a binary image format (image/png), JSON (application/json), or JavaScript (text/javascript). A client may specify what formats it accepts using the `accept` header.

## Cookies


HTTP itself is stateless. This means that one HTTP request does not know anything about a previous or future request. However, that does not mean that a server or client cannot track state across requests. One common method for tracking state is the `cookie`. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Set-Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty
```

This allows the server to remember things like the language preference of the user, or the user's authentication credentials. A server can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does. However, there is nothing inherently evil about cookies; the problem comes from web applications that use them as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data.

## HTTP Versions

HTTP continually evolves in order to increase performance and support new types of applications. You can read about the evolution of HTTP on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP).

| Year | Version | Features                                        |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTTP0.9 | one line, no versions, only get                 |
| 1996 | HTTP1   | get/post, header, status codes, content-type    |
| 1997 | HTTP1.1 | put/patch/delete/options, persistent connection |
| 2015 | HTTP2   | multiplex, server push, binary representation   |
| 2022 | HTTP3   | QUIC for transport protocol, always encrypted   |

# SOP and CORS

Security should always be on your mind when you are working with the web. The ability to provide services to a global audience makes the information on the web very valuable, and therefore an attractive target for nefarious parties. When website architecture and browser clients were still in their infancy they allowed JavaScript to make requests from one domain while displaying a website from a different domain. These are called cross-origin requests.

Consider the following example. An attacker sends out an email with a link to a hacker website (`byu.iinstructure.com`) that is similar to the real course website. Notice the additional `i`. If the hacker website could request anything from the real website then it could make itself appear and act just like the real education website. All it would have to do is request images, html, and login endpoints from the course's website and display the results on the hacker website. This would give the hacker access to everything the user did.

To combat this problem the `Same Origin Policy` (SOP) was created. Simply stated SOP only allows JavaScript to make requests to a domain if it is the same domain that the user is currently viewing. A request from `byu.iinstructure.com` for service endpoints that are made to `byu.instructure.com` would fail because the domains do not match. This provides significant security, but it also introduces complications when building web applications. For example, if you want build a service that any web application can use it would also violate the SOP and fail. In order to address this, the concept of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) was invented.

CORS allows the client (e.g. browser) to specify the origin of a request and then let the server respond with what origins are allowed. The server may say that all origins are allowed, for example if they are a general purpose image provider, or only a specific origin is allowed, for example if they are a bank's authentication service. If the server doesn't specify what origin is allowed then the browser assumes that it must be the same origin.

Going back to our hacker example, the HTTP request from the hacker site (`byu.iinstructure.com`) to the course's authentication service (`byu.instructure.com`) would look like the following.

```http
GET /api/auth/login HTTP/2
Host: byu.instructure.com
Origin: https://byu.iinstructure.com
```

In response the course website would return:

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://byu.instructure.com
```

The browser would then see that the actual origin of the request does not match the allowed origin and so the browser blocks the response and generates an error.

Notice that with CORS, it is the browser that is protecting the user from accessing the course website's authentication endpoint from the wrong origin. CORS is only meant to alert the user that something nefarious is being attempted. A hacker can still proxy requests through their own server to the course website and completely ignore the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Therefore the course website needs to implement its own precautions to stop a hacker from using its services inappropriately.

## Using third party services

When you make requests to your own web services you are always on the same origin and so you will not violate the SOP. However, if you want to make requests to a different domain than the one your web application is hosted on, then you need to make sure that domain allows requests as defined by the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header it returns. For example, if I have JavaScript in my web application loaded from `cs260.click` that makes a fetch request for an image from the website `i.picsum.photos` the browser will fail the request with an HTTP status code of 403 and an error message that CORS has blocked the request.

![CORS](webServicesCors.jpg)

That happens because `i.picsum.photos` does not return an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Without a header the browser assumes that all requests must be made from the same origin.

If your web application instead makes a service request to `icanhazdadjoke.com` to get a joke, that request will succeed because `icanhazdadjoke.com` returns an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a value of `*` meaning that any origin can make requests to this service.

```http
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-origin: *

Did you hear about the bread factory burning down? They say the business is toast.
```

This would have also succeeded if the HTTP header had explicitly listed your web application domain. For example, if you make your request from the origin `cs260.click` the following response would also satisfy CORS.

```http
HTTP/2 200
access-control-allow-origin: https://cs260.click

I’ll tell you something about German sausages, they’re the wurst
```

This all means that you need to test the services you want to use before you include them in your application. Make sure they are responding with `*` or your calling origin. If they do not then you will not be able to use them.

# Fetch

The ability to make HTTP requests from JavaScript is one of the main technologies that changed the web from static content pages (Web 1.0) to one of web applications (Web 2.0) that fully interact with the user. Microsoft introduced the first API for making HTTP requests from JavaScript with the [XMLHttpRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

Today, the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is the preferred way to make HTTP requests. The `fetch` function is built into the browser's JavaScript runtime. This means you can call it from JavaScript code running in a browser.

The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise `then` function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type `application/json` you can use the `json` function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.

The following example makes a fetch request to get and display an inspirational quote.

```js
fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

**Response**

```js
{
  content: 'Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.',
  author: 'Thomas Jefferson',
};
```

To do a POST request you populate the options parameter with the HTTP method and headers.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'test title',
    body: 'test body',
    userId: 1,
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

# Service design

Web services provide the interactive functionality of your web application. They commonly authenticate users, track their session state, provide, store, and analyze data, connect peers, and aggregate user information. Making your web service easy to use, performant, and extensible are factors that determine the success of your application. A good design will result in increased productivity, satisfied users, and lower processing costs.

## Model and sequence diagrams

When first considering your service design it is helpful to model the application's primary objects and the interactions of the objects. You should attempt to stay as close to the model that is in your user's mind as possible. Avoid introducing a model that focuses on programming constructs and infrastructure. For example, a chat program should model participants, conversations, and messages. It should not model user devices, network connections, and data blobs.

Once you have defined your primary objects you can create sequence diagrams that show how the objects interact with each other. This will help clarify your model and define the necessary endpoints. You can use a simple tool like [SequenceDiagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/index.html#initialData=C4S2BsFMAIGEAsCGxqIA5oFCcQY2APYBO0AguCLpDvsdAEIEBG25lkAtAHwDKkRAN34AuPikQDEIcIiZRMjJtz6CRY1JOmz5igDy6OHFUKLC2VDVJlzq5yPsPGRDZpa03Md5fxOjgiIhRcAgA7EwBnZBBQ6AB3MHgXFj0DIx8RWFCIqJiiSABHAFdIcJQQglAAM0ockIVmb1VTUlwqNBQ7aGCw-kjQUPqlXnTTHkQAT2gAIgAJSHBwAinoQjIKKkwnIm47YVn5xeXKogIAWySgA) to create and share diagrams.

![Sequence Diagram](webServicesSequenceDiagram.jpg)

## Leveraging HTTP

Web services are usually provided over HTTP, and so HTTP greatly influences the design of the service. The HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE often mirror the designed actions of a web service. For example, a web service for managing comments might list the comments (GET), create a comment (POST), update a comment (PUT), and delete a comment (DELETE). Likewise, the MIME content types defined by IANA are a natural fit for defining the types of content that you want to provide (e.g. HTML, PNG, MP3, and MP4). The goal is to leverage those technologies as much as possible so that you don't have to recreate the functionality they provide and instead take advantage of the significant networking infrastructure built up around HTTP. This includes caching servers that increase your performance, edge servers that bring your content closer, and replication servers that provide redundant copies of your content and make your application more resilient to network failures.

![HTTP](webServicesHTTPServices.jpg)

## Endpoints

A web service is usually divided up into multiple service endpoints. Each endpoint provides a single functional purpose. All of the criteria that you would apply to creating well designed code functions also applies when exposing service endpoints.

![HTTP](webServicesHTTPEndpoints.jpg)

⚠ Note that service endpoints are often called an Application Programming Interface (API). This is a throwback to old desktop applications and the programming interfaces that they exposed. Sometimes the term API refers to the entire collection of endpoints, and sometimes it is used to refer to a single endpoint.

Here are some things you should consider when designing your service's endpoints.

- **Grammatical** - With HTTP everything is a resource (think noun or object). You act on the resource with an HTTP verb. For example, you might have an order resource that is contained in a store resource. You then create, get, update, and delete order resources on the store resource.
- **Readable** - The resource you are referencing with an HTTP request should be clearly readable in the URL path. For example, an order resource might contain the path to both the order and store where the order resource resides: `/store/provo/order/28502`. This makes it easier to remember how to use the endpoint because it is human readable.
- **Discoverable** - As you expose resources that contain other resources you can provide the endpoints for the aggregated resources. This makes it so someone using your endpoints only needs to remember the top level endpoint and then they can discover everything else. For example, if you have a store endpoint that returns information about a store you can include an endpoint for working with a store in the response.

  ```http
  GET /store/provo  HTTP/2
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "id": "provo",
    "address": "Cougar blvd",
    "orders": "https://cs260.click/store/provo/orders",
    "employees": "https://cs260.click/store/provo/employees"
  }
  ```

- **Compatible** - When you build your endpoints you want to make it so that you can add new functionality without breaking existing clients. Usually this means that the clients of your service endpoints should ignore anything that they don't understand. Consider the two following JSON response versions.

  **Version 1**

  ```js
  {
    "name": "John Taylor"
  }
  ```

  **Version 2**

  ```js
  {
    "name": "John Taylor",
    "givenName": "John",
    "familyName": "Taylor"
  }
  ```

  By adding a new representation of the `name` field, you provide new functionality for clients that know how to use the new fields without harming older clients that ignore the new fields and simply use the old representation. This is all done without officially versioning the endpoint.

  If you are fortunate enough to be able to control all of your client code you can mark the `name` field as depreciated and in a future version remove it once all of the clients have upgraded. Usually you want to keep compatibility with at least one previous version of the endpoint so that there is enough time for all of the clients to migrate before compatibility is removed.

- **Simple** - Keeping your endpoints focused on the primary resources of your application helps to avoid the temptation to add endpoints that duplicate or create parallel access to primary resources. It is very helpful to write some simple class and sequence diagrams that outline your primary resources before you begin coding. These resources should focus on the actual resources of the system you are modeling. They should not focus on the data structure or devices used to host the resources. There should only be one way to act on a resource. Endpoints should only do one thing.

- **Documented** - The [Open API Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) is a good example of tooling that helps create, use, and maintain documentation of your service endpoints. It is highly suggested that you make use of such tools in order to provide client libraries for your endpoints and a sandbox for experimentation. Creating an initial draft of your endpoint documentation before you begin coding will help you mentally clarify your design and produce a better final result. Providing access to your endpoint documentation along with your production system helps with client implementations and facilitates easier maintenance of the service. The [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/) example documentation is a reasonable example to follow.

There are many models for exposing endpoints. We will consider three common ones, RPC, REST, and GraphQL.

## RPC

Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) expose service endpoints as simple function calls. When RPC is used over HTTP it usually just leverages the POST HTTP verb. The actual verb and subject of the function call is represented by the function name. For example, `deleteOrder` or `updateOrder`. The name of the function is either the entire path of the URL or a parameter in the POST body.

```http
POST /updateOrder HTTP/2

{"id": 2197, "date": "20220505"}
```

or

```http
POST /rpc HTTP/2

{"cmd":"updateOrder", "params":{"id": 2197, "date": "20220505"}}
```

One advantage of RPC is that it maps directly to function calls that might exist within the server. This could also be considered a disadvantage as it directly exposes the inner workings of the service, and thus creates a coupling between the endpoints and the implementation.

## REST

Representational State Transfer (REST) attempts to take advantage of the foundational principles of HTTP. This is not surprising considering the principle author of REST, Roy Fielding, was also a contributor to the HTTP specification. REST HTTP verbs always act upon a resource. Operations on a resource impact the state of the resource as it is transferred by a REST endpoint call. This allows for the caching functionality of HTTP to work optimally. For example, GET will always return the same resource until a PUT is executed on the resource. When PUT is used, the cached resource is replaced with the updated resource.

With REST the updateOrder endpoint would look like the following.

```http
PUT /order/2197 HTTP/2

{"date": "20220505"}
```

Where the proper HTTP verb is used and the URL path uniquely identifies the resource. These seem like small differences, but maximizing HTTP pays dividends by making it easy for HTTP infrastructure, such as caching, to work properly.

There are several other pieces of [Fielding's dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) on REST, such as hypermedia, that are often quoted as being required for a truly "restful" implementation, and these are just as often ignored.

## GraphQL

GraphQL focuses on the manipulation of data instead of a function call (RPC) or a resource (REST). The heart of GraphQL is a query that specifies the desired data and how it should be joined and filtered. GraphQL was developed to address frustration concerning the massive number of REST, or RPC calls, that a web application client needed to make in order to support even a simple UI widget.

Instead of making a call for getting a store, and then a bunch of calls for getting the store's orders and employees, GraphQL would send a single query that would request all of that information in one big JSON response. The server would examine the query, join the desired data, and then filter out anything that was not wanted.

Here is an example GraphQL query.

```graphql
query {
  getOrder(id: "2197") {
    orders(filter: {date: {allofterms: "20220505"}}) {
      store
      description
      orderedBy
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL helps to remove a lot of the logic for parsing endpoints and mapping requests to specific resources. Basically in GraphQL there is only one endpoint. The query endpoint.

The downside of that flexibility is that the client now has significant power to consume resources on the server. There is no clear boundary on what, how much, or how complicated the aggregation of data is. It also is difficult for the server to implement authorization rights to data as they have to be baked into the data schema. However, there are standards for how to define a complex schema. Common GraphQL packages provide support for schema implementations along with database adaptors for query support.

# Node.js

![Node Icon](NodeIcon.png)

In 2009 Ryan Dahl created `Node.js`. It was the first successful application for deploying JavaScript outside of a browser. This changed the JavaScript mindset from a browser technology to one that could run on the server as well. This means that JavaScript can power your entire technology stack. One language to rule them all. Node.js is often just referred to as Node, and is currently maintained by the [Open.js Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

![Ryan Dahl](webServicesRyanDahl.jpg)

> “You can never understand everything. But, you should push yourself to understand the system”
>
> — Ryan Dahl

Browsers run JavaScript using a JavaScript interpreter and execution engine. For example, Chromium based browsers all use the [V8](https://v8.dev/) engine created by Google. Node.js simply took the V8 engine and ran it inside of a console application. When you run a JavaScript program in Chrome or Node.js, it is V8 that reads your code and executes it. With either program wrapping V8, the result is the same.

![Node.js](webServicesNode.jpg)

## Installing NVM and Node.js

Your production environment web server comes with Node.js already installed. However, you will need to install Node.js in your development environment if you have not already. The easiest way to install Node.js is to first install the `Node Version Manager` (NVM) and use it to install, and manage, Node.js.

### Installing on Windows

If you are using Windows, then follow the installation instructions from the [windows-nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades) repository. Click on `latest installer` and then scroll down to the `Assets` and download and execute nvm-setup.exe. Once the installation is complete, you will need to open a new console window so that it gets the updated path that includes NVM.

In the console application install the long term support (LTS) version of Node.

```sh
➜ nvm install lts
➜ nvm use lts
```

### Installing on Linux or MacOS

If you are using Linux or MacOS then you can install NVM with the following console commands.

```sh
➜ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

➜ . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

In the console application install the long term support (LTS) version of Node.

```sh
➜ nvm install --lts
```

## Checking that Node is installed

The node.js console application is simply called `node`. You can verify that Node is working correctly by running `node` with the `-v` parameter. Note that your version might be different than what is shown here. As long as it is an LTS version you should be fine.

```sh
➜ node -v
v18.13.0
```

## Running programs

You can execute a line of JavaScript with Node.js from your console with the `-e` parameter.

```sh
➜  node -e "console.log(1+1)"
2
```

However, to do real work you need to execute an entire project composed of dozens or even hundreds of JavaScript files. You do this by creating a single starting JavaScript file, named something like `index.js`, that references the code found in the rest of your project. You then execute your code by running `node` with `index.js` as a parameter. For example, with the following JavaScript saved to a file named `index.js`

```js
function countdown() {
  let i = 0;
  while (i++ < 5) {
    console.log(`Counting ... ${i}`);
  }
}

countdown();
```

We can execute the JavaScript by passing the file to `node`, and receive the following result.

```sh
➜  node index.js
Counting ... 1
Counting ... 2
Counting ... 3
Counting ... 4
Counting ... 5
```

You can also run `node` in interpretive mode by executing it without any parameters and then typing your JavaScript code directly into the interpreter.

```sh
➜ node
Welcome to Node.js v16.15.1.
> 1+1
2
> console.log('hello')
hello
```

## Node package manager

While you could write all of the JavaScript for everything you need, it is always helpful to use preexisting packages of JavaScript for implementing common tasks. To load a package using Node.js you must take two steps. First install the package locally on your machine using the Node Package Manager (NPM), and then include a `require` statement in your code that references the package name. NPM is automatically installed when you install Node.js.

NPM knows how to access a massive repository of preexisting packages. You can search for packages on the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/). However, before you start using NPM to install packages you need to initialize your code to use NPM. This is done by creating a directory that will contain your JavaScript and then running `npm init`. NPM will step you through a series of questions about the project you are creating. You can press the return key for each of questions if you want to accept the defaults. If you are always going to accept all of the defaults you can use `npm init -y` and skip the Q&A.

```sh
➜  mkdir npmtest
➜  cd npmtest
➜  npm init -y
```

## Package.json

If you list the files in the directory you will notice that it has created a file named `package.json`. This file contains three main things: 1) Metadata about your project such as its name and the default entry JavaScript file, 2) commands (scripts) that you can execute to do things like run, test, or distribute your code, and 3) packages that this project depends upon. The following shows what your `package.json` looks like currently. It has some default metadata and a simple placeholder script that just runs the echo command when you execute `npm run test` from the console.

```json
{
  "name": "npmtest",

With NPM initialized to work with your project, you can now use it to install a node package. As a simple example, we will install a package that knows how to tell jokes. This package is called `give-me-a-joke`. You can search for it on the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/), see how often it is installed, examine the source code, and learn about who created it. You install the package using `npm install` followed by the name of the package.

```sh
➜  npm install give-me-a-joke
```

If you again examine the contents of the `package.json` file you will see a reference to the newly installed package dependency. If you decide you no longer want a package dependency you can always remove it with the `npm uninstall <package name here>` console command.

With the dependency added, the unnecessary metadata removed, the addition of a useful script to run the program, and also adding a description, the `package.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "npmtest",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Simple Node.js demo",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "give-me-a-joke": "^0.5.1"
  }
}
```

⚠ Note that when you start installing package dependencies, NPM will create an additional file named `package-lock.json` and a directory named `node_modules` in your project directory. The `node_modules` directory contains the actual JavaScript files for the package and all of its dependent packages. As you install several packages this directory will start to get very large. You do **not** want to check this directory into your source control system since it can be very large and can be rebuilt using the information contained in the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. So make sure you include `node_modules` in your `.gitignore` file.

When you clone your source code from GitHub to a new location, the first thing you should do is run `npm install` in the project directory. This will cause NPM to download all of the previously installed packages and recreate the `node_modules` directory.

The `package-lock.json` file tracks the version of the package that you installed. That way if rebuild your `node_modules` directory you will have the version of the package you initially installed and not the latest available version, which might not be compatible with your code.

With NPM and the joke package installed, you can now use the joke package in a JavaScript file by referencing the package name as a parameter to the `require` function. This is then followed by a call to the joke object's `getRandomDadJoke` function to actually generate a joke. Create a file named `index.js` and paste the following into it.

**index.js**

```js
const giveMeAJoke = require('give-me-a-joke');
giveMeAJoke.getRandomDadJoke((joke) => {
  console.log(joke);
});
```

If you run this code using `node.js` you should get a result similar to the following.

```sh
➜  node index.js
What do you call a fish with no eyes? A fsh.
```

This may seem like a lot of work but after you do it a few times it will begin to feel natural. Just remember the main steps.

1. Create your project directory
1. Initialize it for use with NPM by running `npm init -y`
1. Make sure `.gitignore` file contains `node_modules`
1. Install any desired packages with `npm install <package name here>`
1. Add `require('<package name here>')` to your application's JavaScript
1. Use the code the package provides in your JavaScript
1. Run your code with `node index.js`

## Creating a web service

With JavaScript we can write code that listens on a network port (e.g. 80, 443, 3000, or 8080), receives HTTP requests, processes them, and then responds. We can use this to create a simple web service that we then execute using Node.js.

First create your project.

```sh
➜ mkdir webservicetest
➜ cd webservicetest
➜ npm init -y
```

Now, open VS Code and create a file named `index.js`. Paste the following code into the file and save.

```js
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
  res.write(`<h1>Hello Node.js! [${req.method}] ${req.url}</h1>`);
  res.end();
});

server.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log(`Web service listening on port 8080`);
});
```

This code uses the Node.js built in `http` package to create our HTTP server using the `http.createServer` function along with a callback function that takes a request (`req`) and response (`res`) object. That function is called whenever the server receives an HTTP request. In our example, the callback always returns the same HTML snippet, with a status code of 200, and a Content-Type header, no matter what request is made. Basically this is just a simple dynamically generated HTML page. A real web service would examine the HTTP path and return meaningful content based upon the purpose of the endpoint.

The `server.listen` call starts listening on port 8080 and blocks until the program is terminated.

We execute the program by going back to our console window and running Node.js to execute our index.js file. If the service starts up correctly then it should look like the following.

```sh
➜ node index.js
Web service listening on port 8080
```

You can now open your browser and point it to `localhost:8080` and view the result. The interaction between the JavaScript, node, and the browser looks like this.

![Node HTTP](webServicesNodeHttp.jpg)

Use different URL paths in the browser and note that it will echo the HTTP method and path back in the document. You can kill the process by pressing `CTRL-C` in the console.

Note that you can also start up Node and execute the `index.js` code directly in VS Code. To do this open index.js in VS Code and press the 'F5' key. This should ask you what program you want to run. Select `node.js`. This starts up Node.js with the `index.js` file, but also attaches a debugger so that you can set breakpoints in the code and step through each line of code.

⚠ Make sure you complete the above steps. For the rest of the course you will be executing your code using Node.js to run your backend code and serve up your frontend code to the browser. This means you will no longer be using the `VS Code Live Server extension` to serve your frontend code in the browser.

## Deno and Bun

You should be aware that Ryan has created a successor to Node.js called [`Deno`](https://deno.land/). This version is more compliant with advances in ECMAScript and has significant performance enhancements. There are also competitor server JavaScript applications. One of the more interesting rising stars is called [`Bun`](https://bun.sh/). If you have the time you should learn about them.

# Express

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Express/Node introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

In the previous instruction you saw how to use Node.js to create a simple web server. This works great for little projects where you are trying to quickly serve up some web content, but to build a production ready application you need a framework with a bit more functionality for easily implementing a full web service. This is where the Node package `Express` come in. Express provides support for:

1. Routing requests for service endpoints
1. Manipulating HTTP requests with JSON body content
1. Generating HTTP responses
1. Using `middleware` to add functionality

Express was created by TJ Holowaychuk and is currently maintained by the [Open.js Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

![TJ Holowaychuk](webServicesHolowaychuk.jpg)

> “People tell you to not reinvent things, but I think you should … it will teach you things”
>
> — TJ Holowaychuk

Everything in Express revolves around creating and using HTTP routing and middleware functions.
You create an Express application by using NPM to install the Express package and then calling the `express` constructor to create the Express application and listen for HTTP requests on a desired port.

```sh
➜ npm install express
```

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.listen(8080);
```

With the `app` object you can now add HTTP routing and middleware functions to the application.

## Defining routes

HTTP endpoints are implemented in Express by defining routes that call a function based upon an HTTP path. The Express `app` object supports all of the HTTP verbs as functions on the object. For example, if you want to have a route function that handles an HTTP GET request for the URL path `/store/provo` you would call the `get` method on the app.

```js
app.get('/store/provo', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({name: 'provo'});
});
```

The `get` function takes two parameters, a URL path matching pattern, and a callback function that is invoked when the pattern matches. The path matching parameter is used to match against the URL path of an incoming HTTP request.

The callback function has three parameters that represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` routing function that Express expects to be called if this routing function wants another function to generate a response.

The Express `app` compares the routing function patterns in the order that they are added to the Express `app` object. So if you have two routing functions with patterns that both match, the first one that was added will be called and given the next matching function in the `next` parameter.

In our example above we hard coded the store name to be `provo`. A real store endpoint would allow any store name to be provided as a parameter in the path. Express supports path parameters by prefixing the parameter name with a colon (`:`). Express creates a map of path parameters and populates it with the matching values found in the URL path. You then reference the parameters using the `req.params` object. Using this pattern you can rewrite our getStore endpoint as follows.

```js
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({name: req.params.storeName});
});
```

If we run our JavaScript using `node` we can see the result when we make an HTTP request using `curl`.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/store/orem
{"name":"orem"}
```

If you wanted an endpoint that used the POST or DELETE HTTP verb then you just use the `post` or `delete` function on the Express `app` object.

The route path can also include a limited wildcard syntax or even full regular expressions in path pattern. Here are a couple route functions using different pattern syntax.

```js
// Wildcard - matches /store/x and /star/y
app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({update: req.params.storeName}));

// Pure regular expression
app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({delete: req.params[0]}));
```

Notice that in these examples the `next` parameter was omitted. Since we are not calling `next` we do not need to include it as a parameter. However, if you do not call `next` then no following middleware functions will be invoked for the request.

## Using middleware

The standard [Mediator/Middleware](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/mediator-pattern/) design pattern has two pieces: a mediator and middleware. Middleware represents componentized pieces of functionality. The mediator loads the middleware components and determines their order of execution. When a request comes to the mediator it then passes the request around to the middleware components. Following this pattern, Express is the mediator, and middleware functions are the middleware components.

Express comes with a standard set of middleware functions. These provide functionality like routing, authentication, CORS, sessions, serving static web files, cookies, and logging. Some middleware functions are provided by default, and other ones must be installed using NPM before you can use them. You can also write your own middleware functions and use them with Express.

A middleware function looks very similar to a routing function. That is because routing functions are also middleware functions. The only difference is that routing functions are only called if the associated pattern matches. Middleware functions are always called for every HTTP request unless a preceding middleware function does not call `next`. A middleware function has the following pattern:

```js
function middlewareName(req, res, next)
```

The middleware function parameters represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function to pass processing to. You should usually call the `next` function after completing processing so that the next middleware function can execute.

![Middleware](webServicesMiddleware.jpg)

### Creating your own middleware

As an example of writing your own middleware, you can create a function that logs out the URL of the request and then passes on processing to the next middleware function.

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});
```

Remember that the order that you add your middleware to the Express app object controls the order that the middleware functions are called. Any middleware that does not call the `next` function after doing its processing, stops the middleware chain from continuing.

### Builtin middleware

In addition to creating your own middleware functions, you can use a built-in middleware function. Here is an example of using the `static` middleware function. This middleware responds with static files, found in a given directory, that match the request URL.

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Now if you create a subdirectory in your project directory and name it `public` you can serve up any static content that you would like. For example, you could create an `index.html` file that is the default content for your web service. Then when you call your web service without any path the `index.html` file will be returned.

### Third party middleware

You can also use third party middleware functions by using NPM to install the package and including the package in your JavaScript with the `require` function. The following uses the `cookie-parser` package to simplify the generation and access of cookies.

```sh
➜ npm install cookie-parser
```

```js
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/cookie/:name/:value', (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie(req.params.name, req.params.value);
  res.send({cookie: `${req.params.name}:${req.params.value}`});
});

app.get('/cookie', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({cookie: req.cookies});
});
```

It is common for middleware functions to add fields and functions to the `req` and `res` objects so that other middleware can access the functionality they provide. You see this happening when the `cookie-parser` middleware adds the `req.cookies` object for reading cookies, and also adds the `res.cookie` function in order to make it easy to add a cookie to a response.

## Error handling middleware

You can also add middleware for handling errors that occur. Error middleware looks similar to other middleware functions, but it takes an additional `err` parameter that contains the error.

```js
function errorMiddlewareName(err, req, res, next)
```

If you wanted to add a simple error handler for anything that might go wrong while processing HTTP requests you could add the following.

```js
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({type: err.name, message: err.message});
});
```

We can test that our error middleware is getting used by adding a new endpoint that generates an error.

```js
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});
```

Now if we use `curl` to call our error endpoint we can see that the response comes from the error middleware.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/error
{"type":"Error","message":"Trouble in river city"}
```

## Putting it all together

Here is a full example of our web service built using Express.

```js
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const app = express();

// Third party middleware - Cookies
app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/cookie/:name/:value', (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie(req.params.name, req.params.value);
  res.send({cookie: `${req.params.name}:${req.params.value}`});
});

app.get('/cookie', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({cookie: req.cookies});
});

// Creating your own middleware - logging
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});

// Built in middleware - Static file hosting
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Routing middleware
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res) => {
  res.send({name: req.params.storeName});
});

app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({update: req.params.storeName}));

app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({delete: req.params[0]}));

// Error middleware
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({type: err.name, message: err.message});
});

// Listening to a network port
const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```
# Debugging Node.js

🔑 **Required reading**: [Debugging a Node.js application](https://youtu.be/B0le_Z_2TQY)

Previously your JavaScript debugging was done by running the `Live Server` VS Code extension and using the browser's debugging tools as it executed in the browser. Now that you are writing JavaScript that runs using Node.js, you need a way to launch and debug your code that runs outside of the browser. One great way to do that is to use the debugging tools built into VS Code. To debug JavaScript in VS Code you first need some JavaScript to debug. Open up VS Code and create a new file named `main.js` and paste the following code into the file.

```js
let x = 1 + 1;

console.log(x);

function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}

x = double(x);

console.log(x);
```

You can now debug `main.js` in VS Code by executing the `Start Debugging` command by pressing `F5`. The first time you run this, VS Code will ask you what debugger you want to use. Select `Node.js`.

![Debug start](webServicesDebugStart.png)

The code will execute and the debug console window will automatically open to show you the debugger output where you can see the results of the two `console.log` statements found in the code.

![Debug output](webServicesDebugOutput.png)

You can pause execution of the code by setting a breakpoint. Move your cursor over to the far left side of the editor window. As you hover on the left side of the line numbers you will see a red dot appear. Click on the dot to set the breakpoint.

![Debug output](webServicesDebugBreakpoint.png)

Now start the debugger again by pressing `F5`. The code will start running, but pause on the line with the breakpoint. You can then see the values of variables by looking at the variable window on the left, or by hovering your mouse over the variable you would like to inspect.

![Debug pause](webServicesDebugPaused.png)

You can continue execution of the code by pressing `F10` to step to the next line, `F11` to step into a function call, or `F5` to continue running from the current line. When the last line of code executes the debugger will automatically exit and you will need to press `F5` to start it running again. You can stop debugging at any time by pressing `SHIFT-F5`.

Experiment with this simple file until you are comfortable running the debugger, setting breakpoints, and inspecting variables.

## Debugging a Node.js web service

In order to debug a web service running under Node.js we first need to write our code. Replace the code in your `main.js` file with the following.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/*', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ url: req.originalUrl });
});

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Switch to your console application and run `npm init -y` and `npm install express` from your code directory so that we can use the Express package to write a simple web service.

Now we are ready to debug again. Set a breakpoint on the getStore endpoint callback (line 5) and the `app.listen` call (line 9). Start debugging by pressing `F5`. The debugger should stop on the `listen` call where you can inspect the `app` variable. Press `F5` again to continue running. Now open up your browser and set the location to `localhost:8080`. This should hit the breakpoint on the endpoint. Take some time to inspect the `req` object. You should be able to see what the HTTP method is, what parameters are provided, and what the path currently is. Press `F5` to continue.

Your browser should display the JSON object, containing the URL, that you returned from your endpoint. Now change the URL in the browser to include a path and some query parameters. Something like `http://localhost:8080/fish/taco?order=2`. Requesting that URL should cause your breakpoint to hit again where you can see the URL changes reflected in the req object.

Now, instead of pressing `F5` to continue, press `F11` to step into the `res.send` function. This will take you out of your code and into the Express code that handles sending a response. Because you installed the Express package using NPM, all of Express's source code is sitting in the `node_modules` directory. You can also set breakpoints there, examine variables, and step into functions. Debugging into popular packages is a great way to learn how to code by seeing how really good programmers do things. Take some time to walk around Holowaychuk's code and see if you can understand what it is doing.

![Debug step in](webServicesDebugStepIn.png)

## Nodemon

Once you start writing complex web applications you will find yourself making changes in the middle of debugging sessions and you would like to have `node` restart automatically and update the browser as the changes are saved. This seems like a simple thing, but over the course of hundreds of changes, every second you can save really starts to add up.

The [Nodemon package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is basically a wrapper around `node` that watches for files in the project directory to change. When it detects that you saved something it will automatically restart `node`.

If you would like to experiment with this then take the following steps. First install Nodemon globally so that you can use it to debug all of your projects.

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
```

Then, because VS Code does not know how to launch Nodemon automatically, you need create a VS Code launch configuration. In VS Code press `CTRL-SHIFT-P` (on Windows) or `⌘-SHIFT-P` (on Mac) and type the command `Debug: Add configuration`. This will then ask you what type of configuration you would like to create. Type `Node.js` and select the `Node.js: Nodemon setup` option. In the launch configuration file that it creates, change the program from `app.js` to `main.js` (or whatever the main JavaScript file is for your application) and save the configuration file.

Now when you press `F5` to start debugging it will run Nodemon instead of Node.js, and your changes will automatically update your application when you save.

# PM2

When you run a program from the console, the program will automatically terminate when you close the console or if the computer restarts. In order to keep programs running after a shutdown you need to register it as a `daemon`. The term daemon comes from the idea of something that is always there working in the background. Hopefully you only have good daemons running in your background.

We want our web services to continue running as a daemon. We would also like an easy way to start and stop our services. That is what [Process Manager 2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) (PM2) does.

PM2 is already installed on your production server as part of the AWS AMI that you selected when you launched your server. Additionally, the deployment scripts found with the Simon projects automatically modify PM2 to register and restart your web services. That means you should not need to do anything with PM2. However, if you run into problems such as your services not running, then here are some commands that you might find useful.

You can SSH into your server and see PM2 in action by running the following command.

```sh
pm2 ls
```

This should print out the two services, simon and startup, that are configured to run on your web server.

You can try some of the other commands, but only if you understand what they are doing. Using them incorrectly could cause your web services to stop working.

## Registering a new web service

If you want to setup another subdomain that accesses a different web service on your web server, you need to follow these steps.

1. Add the rule to the Caddyfile to tell it how to direct requests for the domain.
2. Create a directory and add the files for the web service.
3. Configure PM2 to host the web service.

### Modify Caddyfile

SSH into your server.

Copy the section for the startup subdomain and alter it so that it represents the desired subdomain and give it a different port number that is not currently used on your server. For example:

```sh
tacos.cs260.click {
  reverse_proxy _ localhost:5000
  header Cache-Control none
  header -server
  header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *
}
```

This tells Caddy that when it gets a request for tacos.cs260.click it will act as a proxy for those requests and pass them on to the web service that is listening on the same machine (localhost), on port 5000. The other settings tell Caddy to return headers that disable caching, hide the fact that Caddy is the server (no reason to tell hackers anything about your server), and to allow any other origin server to make endpoint requests to this subdomain (basically disabling CORS). Depending on what your web service does you may want different settings.

Restart Caddy to cause it to load the new settings.

```sh
sudo service caddy restart
```

Now Caddy will attempt to proxy the requests, but there is no web service listening on port 5000 and so you will get an error from Caddy if you make a request to tacos.cs260.click.

### Create the web service

Copy the `~/services/startup` directory to a directory that represents the purpose of your service. For example:

```sh
cp -r ~/services/startup ~/services/tacos
```

If you list the directory you should see an `index.js` file that is the main JavaScript file for your web service. It has the code to listen on the designated network port and respond to requests. The following is the JavaScript that causes the web service to listen on a port that is provided as an argument to the command line.

```js
const port = process.argv.length > 2 ? process.argv[2] : 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

There is also a directory named `public` that has static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that your web service will respond with when requested. The `index.js` file enables this with the following code:

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

You can start up the web service, listening on port 5000, using Node as follows.

```sh
node index.js 5000
```

You can now access your web service through the browser, or `curl`.

```sh
curl https://tacos.cs260.click
```

Caddy will receive the request and map the subdomain name, tacos.cs260.click, to a request for http://localhost:5000. Your web service is listening on port 5000 and so it receives the request and responds.

Stop your web service by pressing CTRL-C in the SSH console that you used to start the service. Now your browser request for your subdomain should return an error again.

### Configure PM2 to host the web service

The problem with running your web service from the console with `node index.js 5000`, is that as soon as you close your SSH session it will terminate all processes you started in that session, including your web service. Instead you need something that is always running in the background to run your web service. This is where daemons come into play. The daemon we use to do this is called PM2.

From your SSH console session run:

```sh
pm2 ls
```

This will list the web services that you already have registered with PM2. To run your newly created web service under PM2, make sure you are in your service directory, and run the command similar to the following, with the service name and port substituted to your desired values:

```sh
cd ~/services/tacos
pm2 start index.js -n tacos -- 5000
pm2 save
```

If you run `pm2 ls` again you should see your web service listed. You can now access your subdomain in the browser and see the proper response. PM2 will keep running your service even after you exit your SSH session.

# UI testing

[Test driven development](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/) (TDD) is a proven methodology for accelerating application creation, protecting against regression bugs, and demonstrating correctness. TDD for console based applications and server based code is fairly straight forward. Web application UI code is significantly more complex to test, and using automated tests to drive your UI development is even more difficult.

The problem is that a browser is required to execute UI code. That means you have to actually test the application in the browser. Additionally, every one of the major browsers behaves slightly differently, viewport size makes a big difference, all the code executes asynchronously, network disruptions are common, and then there is the human factor. A human will interact with the browser in very unexpected ways. Clicking where they shouldn't, clicking rapidly, randomly refreshing the browser, flushing cache, not flushing cache, leaving the application up for days on end, switching between tabs, opening the application multiple times, logging in on different tabs, logging out of one tab while still using the application on another tab, or ... on and on. And we haven't even talked about running all the different browsers on all of the possible devices.

Of course the alternative to not test your code doesn't work either. That only means that you have to manually test everything every time you make any change, or you let your users test everything. That is not a good recipe for long term success.

Fortunately this is a problem that many strong players have been working on for decades now, and the solutions, while not perfect, are getting better and better. We will look at two of these solutions. One is for executing automated tests in the browser, and the other is for testing on different browsers and devices.

## Automating the browser - Playwright

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [Playwright and VS Code](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-VSCode)

No one understands the difficulty of testing applications in a browser better than the companies that build web browsers. They have to test every possible use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that a user could think of. There is no way that manual testing is going to work and so early on they started putting hooks into their browsers that allowed them to be driven from automated external processes. [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) was introduced in 2004 as the first popular tool to automate the browser. However, Selenium is generally considered to be flaky and slow. Flakiness means that a test fails in unpredictable, unreproducible ways. When you need thousands of tests to pass before you can deploy a new feature, even a little flakiness becomes a big problem. If those tests take hours to run then you have an even bigger problem.

The market now has lots of alternatives when considering which automated browser framework to use. [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com/) includes statistics on how popular these frameworks are. With frameworks coming and going all of the time, one telling statistic is the frameworks' ability to retain users.

![State of JS testing](javascriptStateOfJsTesting.jpg)

— Retention of browser based testing frameworks (**Source**: _2021.stateofjs.com_)

For the purposes of this instruction, we could pick any of the top contenders. However, we are going to pick a newcomer, [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Playwright has some major advantages. It is backed by Microsoft, it integrates really well with VS Code, and it runs as a Node.js process. It is also considered one of the least flaky of the testing frameworks.

As a demonstration of using Playwright, consider the following simplified HTML file containing a button that changes the paragraph text. The button calls a JavaScript function defined in a script element located in the HTML file.

```HTML
<body>
  <p id="welcome" data-testid="msg">Hello world</p>
  <button onclick="changeWelcome()">change welcome</button>
  <script>
    function changeWelcome() {
      const welcomeEl = document.querySelector('#welcome');
      welcomeEl.textContent = 'I feel welcomed';
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

First, you need to install Playwright. In your project directory, use NPM to download the Playwright packages, install the browser drivers, configure your project, and create a couple example test files.

```sh
npm init playwright@latest
```

Next, you want to install the Playwright extension for VS Code. Go to the extensions tab in VS Code and search for, and install, `Playwright Test for VSCode`.

You can now write your first Playwright test. Take the following and paste it over the `tests/example.spec.js` file that the Playwright install created.

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('testWelcomeButton', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to the welcome page
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5500/');

  // Get the target element and make sure it is in the correct starting state
  const hello = page.getByTestId('msg');
  await expect(hello).toHaveText('Hello world');

  // Press the button
  const changeBtn = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'change welcome' });
  await changeBtn.click();

  // Expect that the change happened correctly
  await expect(hello).toHaveText('I feel not welcomed');
});
```

This test makes sure you can successfully navigate to the desired page, that the page contains the desired elements, that you can press the button and the text changes as expected.

Before you run the test, you actually need your application running for the test to execute against. You can do this by using the VS Code Live Server extension, or if you are testing a Node.js based service then run `npm run start`. You can actually add configuration to your tests so that your application is started when your tests run, but for now, just start up your application before you run the test.

To run the test in VS Code, select the `Test Explorer` tab. You should see your test listed in the explorer. Select the `example.spec.ts` test and press the play button. This will start the test, launch a browser, run the test code to interact with the browser, and display the result. In this case our test fails because it is expecting the resulting text to be `I feel not welcomed` when it actually displays `I feel welcomed`.

The following image should be similar to what you see. You can see the listing of tests on the left and the JavaScript based test in the editor window on the right. When a test fails, the editor window displays a clear description of what went wrong. You can even debug the tests as they execute just like you would any other Node.js based JavaScript execution.

![Playwright](javaScriptPlaywright.png)

You can fix the test by either changing `index.html` or `test/example.spec.js` so that the text matches. Once you have done that you can run the test again and the test explorer should display a green check box.

This is just a simple example of the powerful functionality of Playwright. You are encouraged to explore its functionality and even add some tests to your projects. Once you have gained some competency with Playwright you will find that you can write your code faster and feel more confident when changing things around.

## Testing various devices - BrowserStack

With the ability to run automated UI tests, we now turn our attention to testing on the multitude of various devices. There are several services out there that help with this. One of these is [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). BrowserStack lets you pick from a long list of physical devices that you can run interactively, or use when driving automated tests with Selenium. The image below only shows a partial list of iPhone devices. BrowserStack also has devices for Android, Mac, and Windows.

![BrowserStack devices](javaScriptBrowserStackDevices.png)

When you launch a device it connects the browser interface to a physical device hosted in a data center. You can then use the device to reproduce user reported problems, or validate that your implementation works on that specific device. The following image shows the use of BrowserStack to experiment with an iPhone 14 running iOS 16.

![BrowserStack iPhone](javaScriptBrowserStackIPhone.png)

BrowserStack offers free trials if you would like to see how your startup application works on a specific device.

# Endpoint testing

Using test driven development (TDD) for testing service endpoints is a common industry practice. Testing services is usually easier than writing UI tests because it does not require a browser. However, it does still take effort to learn how to write tests that are effective and efficient. Making this a standard part of your development process will give you a significant advantage as you progress in your professional career.

As demonstrated by the following [State of JS](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/testing/) survey, there are lots of good testing packages that work well with Express driven services. We are going to look at the current champion [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

![State of JS Testing](webServicesStateOfJsEndpointTesting.jpg)

To get started with Jest we need a simple web service. In a console window, create a test directory, install Express, and open up VS Code.

```sh
mkdir testJest
cd testJest
npm init -y
npm install express
code .
```

Now create a file named `server.js` and use Express to create an application with two endpoints: one to get a store (getStore), and another to update a store.

**server.js**

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// Endpoints
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ name: req.params.storeName });
});

app.put('/store/:storeName', (req, res) => {
  req.body.updated = true;
  res.send(req.body);
});

module.exports = app;
```

In order to allow Jest to start up the HTTP server when running tests, we initialize the application a little bit differently than we have in the past. Normally, we would have just started listening on the Express `app` object after we defined our endpoints. Instead we export the Express `app` object from our `server.js` file and then import the app object in the `index.js` file that is used to run our service.

**index.js**

```js
const app = require('./server');

const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Breaking apart the definition of the service from the starting of the service allows us to start the service both when we run normally and also when using our testing framework.

![Jest endpoint requests](endpointTestingJest.jpg)

You can test that the service is working properly by running the service in the VS Code debugger and pressing F5 while viewing the `index.js` file. Then open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/store/provo`. Stop the debugging session once you have demonstrated that the service is working correctly.

To launch the service using Jest we create another file that has a suffix of `.test.js`. Any file with that suffix is considered a testing file and will automatically be discovered by Jest and examined for tests to run.

## A simple test

Before we write tests for our endpoints we will write a simple test that demonstrates how Jest works. A test is created by calling the Jest `test` function. Note that you don't need to include a `require` statement to import Jest functions into your code. Jest will automatically import itself when it discovers a test file.

Let's make our first test by creating a file named `store.test.js` and pasting in the following code.

**store.test.js**

```js
test('that equal values are equal', () => {
  expect(false).toBe(true);
});
```

The `test` function takes a description as the first parameter. The description is meant to be human readable. In this case it reads: "test that equal values are equal". The second parameter is the function to call. Our function just calls the Jest `expect` function and chains it to the `toBe` function. You can read this as "expect false to be true", which of course is not true, but we want to see our test fail the first time we run it. We will fix this later so that we can show what happens when a test succeeds.

In order to run the test we need to install the Jest package using NPM. From the console install the package. The `-D` parameter tells NPM to install Jest as a development package. That keeps it from being included when we do production release builds.

```sh
npm install jest -D
```

Now, replace the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file with a new command that will run our tests with Jest.

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
},
```

With that in place we can run the `test` command and our test will execute. Notice that Jest shows exactly where the test failed and what expected values were not received.

```sh
➜ npm run test

 FAIL  ./store.test.js
  ✕ that unequal values are not equal (1 ms)

  ● that unequal values are not equal

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: true
    Received: false

      3 |
      4 | test('that unequal values are not equal', () => {
    > 5 |   expect(false).toBe(true);
        |                 ^
      6 | });
      7 |
      8 | // describe('endpoints', () => {

      at Object.toBe (store.test.js:5:17)

Tests:       1 failed, 1 total
```

We can then fix our test by rewriting it so that the expected value matches the provided value.

**store.test.js**

```js
test('that equal values are equal', () => {
  expect(true).toBe(true);
});
```

This time when we run the test it passes.

```sh
➜  npm run test

 PASS  ./store.test.js
  ✓ that equal values are equal (1 ms)

Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
```

Note that this example didn't actually test any of our code, but it does demonstrate how easy it is to write tests. A real test function would call code in your program. Let's do this by actually making calls to our endpoints.

## Testing endpoints

To test our endpoints we need another package so that we can make HTTP requests without having to actually send them over the network. This is done with the NPM package called `supertest`. Go ahead and install this now.

```sh
npm install supertest -D
```

We can then alter `store.test.js` to import our Express service and also the `request` function from `supertest` that we will use to make HTTP requests.

To make an HTTP request you pass the Express `app` to the `supertest` `request` function and then chain on the HTTP verb function that you want to call, along with the endpoint path. You can then chain on as many `expect` functions as you would like. In the following example we will expect an HTTP status code of 200 (OK), and that the body of the response contains the object that we expect the endpoint to return.

If something goes wrong, the `end` function will contain an error and we pass the error along to the `done` function. Otherwise we just call `done` without the error.

**store.test.js**

```js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./server');

test('getStore returns the desired store', (done) => {
  request(app)
    .get('/store/provo')
    .expect(200)
    .expect({ name: 'provo' })
    .end((err) => (err ? done(err) : done()));
});
```

When we run this test we see that it passes without error.

```sh
➜  npm run test

 PASS  ./store.test.js
  ✓ getStore returns the desired store (16 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.237 s, estimated 1 s
```

You can change the test to expect a status code of 500 (Server Error) if you want to see the test fail. You can also change the endpoint code to return a 201 status code (Created) and also see the test fail.

Now we can add a test for the updateStore endpoint. To do this we can copy the getStore endpoint, change the description, change the HTTP function verb to `put`, and send the body of the `put` request using the chained `send` function.

```js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('./server');

test('updateStore saves the correct values', (done) => {
  request(app)
    .put('/store/provo')
    .send({ items: ['fish', 'milk'] })
    .expect(200)
    .expect({ items: ['fish', 'milk'], updated: true })
    .end((err) => (err ? done(err) : done()));
});

test('getStore returns the desired store', (done) => {
  request(app)
    .get('/store/provo')
    .expect(200)
    .expect({ name: 'provo' })
    .end((err) => (err ? done(err) : done()));
});
```

The great thing about test driven development (TDD) is that you can actually write your tests first and then write your code based upon the design represented by the tests. When your tests pass you know your code is complete. Additionally, when you make later modifications to your code you can simply run your tests again. If they pass then you can be confident that your code is still working without having to manually test everything yourself. With systems that have hundreds of endpoints and hundreds of thousands of lines of code, TDD becomes an indispensable part of the development process.

# Simon Service

![Simon](../simon.png)

This deliverable demonstrates converting the JavaScript application into a web application by implementing a web service that listens on a network port for HTTP requests. The web service provides endpoints for getting and updating the scores. The application also uses a couple third party endpoints to display inspirational quotes on the about page and show a random header image.

We will use Node.js and Express to create our HTTP service.

You can view this application running here: [Example Simon Service](https://simon-service.cs260.click)

![Simon Service](simonService.jpg)

## Service endpoint definitions

Here is our design, documented using `curl` commands, for the two endpoints that the Simon web service provides.

**GetScores** - Get the latest high scores.

```sh
curl -X GET /api/scores

#Response
{ "scores":[
  {"name":"Harvey", "score":"337", "date":"2022/11/20"},
  {"name":"도윤 이", "score":"95", "date":"2019/05/20"}
]}
```

**SubmitScore** - Submit a score for consideration in the list of high scores.

```sh
curl -X POST /api/score -d '{"name":"Harvey", "score":"337", "date":"2022/11/20"}'

#Response
{ "scores":[
  {"name":"Harvey", "score":"337", "date":"2022/11/20"},
  {"name":"도윤 이", "score":"95", "date":"2019/05/20"}
]}
```

## Third party endpoints

The `about.js` file contains code for making calls to third party endpoints using `fetch`. We make one call to `picsum.photos` to get a random picture and another to `quotable.io` to get a random quote. Once the endpoint asynchronously returns, the DOM is updated with the requested data. Here is an example of the quote endpoint call.

```js
function displayQuote(data) {
  fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      const containerEl = document.querySelector('#quote');

      const quoteEl = document.createElement('p');
      quoteEl.classList.add('quote');
      const authorEl = document.createElement('p');
      authorEl.classList.add('author');

      quoteEl.textContent = data.content;
      authorEl.textContent = data.author;

      containerEl.appendChild(quoteEl);
      containerEl.appendChild(authorEl);
    });
}
```

## Steps to convert Simon to a service

Converting Simon to a service involved the following steps.

1. Move all the previous deliverable code files (_.html, _.js, \*.css, favicon.ico, and assets) into a sub-directory named `public`. We will use the HTTP Node.js based service to host the frontend application files. This is done with the static file middleware that we will add our service `index.js`.

   ```js
   app.use(express.static('public'));
   ```

   When running our service the static file middleware takes care of reading the frontend code from the `public` directory and returning it to the browser. The service only directly handles the endpoint requests.

   ![Simon service](../simonReact/simonProduction.jpg)

1. Within the project directory run `npm init -y`. This configures the directory to work with **node.js**.
1. Modify or create `.gitignore` to ignore `node_modules`.
1. Install the Express package by running `npm install express`. This will write the Express package dependency in the `package.json` file and install all the Express code to the `node_modules` directory.
1. Create a file named `index.js` in the root of the project. This is the entry point that **node.js** will call when you run your web service.
1. Add the basic Express JavaScript code needed to host the application static content and the desired endpoints.

   ```js
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // The service port. In production the frontend code is statically hosted by the service on the same port.
   const port = process.argv.length > 2 ? process.argv[2] : 3000;

   // JSON body parsing using built-in middleware
   app.use(express.json());

   // Serve up the frontend static content hosting
   app.use(express.static('public'));

   // Router for service endpoints
   const apiRouter = express.Router();
   app.use(`/api`, apiRouter);

   // GetScores
   apiRouter.get('/scores', (_req, res) => {
     res.send(scores);
   });

   // SubmitScore
   apiRouter.post('/score', (req, res) => {
     scores = updateScores(req.body, scores);
     res.send(scores);
   });

   // Return the application's default page if the path is unknown
   app.use((_req, res) => {
     res.sendFile('index.html', { root: 'public' });
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

1. Modify the Simon application code to make service endpoint requests to our newly created HTTP service code.

   ```js
   async function loadScores() {
     const response = await fetch("/api/scores")
     const scores = await response.json()

     // Modify the DOM to display the scores
   ```

## Study this code

Get familiar with what the example code teaches.

- Clone the repository to your development environment.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-service.git
  ```

- Review the code and get comfortable with everything it represents.
- Debug the code in your browser by hosting it from a VS Code debug session. This [video on debugging a node.js based service](https://youtu.be/B0le_Z_2TQY) will step you through the process.

  ⚠ You will no longer use the `live server` extension to launch your frontend code in the browser since your frontend code will now be served up by the Node.js server you created in `index.js`. Set breakpoints in your backend code inside of VS Code.

- Use the browser's dev tools to set breakpoints in the frontend code and step through it each line.
- Make modifications to the code as desired. Experiment and see what happens.

## Deploy to production

- Deploy to your production environment using a copy of the `deployService.sh` script found in the [example class application](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-service/blob/main/deployService.sh). Take some time to understand how it works.

  ```sh
  ./deployService.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s simon
  ```

  For example,

  ```sh
  ./deployService.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon
  ```

  ⚠ **NOTE** - The deployment script for this project is different from previous deployment scripts, since it needs to set up the Node.js service for your backend code, and copy your frontend code to the `public` directory. You also want to make sure that your Node.js HTTP service code for Simon is configured to listen on port 3000. When you deploy your Startup you want to make sure that code is configured to listen on port 4000.

- Update your `startup` repository `notes.md` with what you learned.
- Make sure your project is visible from your production environment (e.g. https://simon.yourdomain.click).

# Storage services

Web applications commonly need to store files associated with the application or the users of the application. This includes files such as images, user uploads, documents, and movies. Files usually have an ID, some metadata, and the bytes representing the file itself. These can be stored using a database service, but usually that is overkill and a simpler solution will be cheaper.

It might be tempting to store files directly on your server. This is usually a bad idea for several reasons.

1. Your server has limited drive space. If you server runs out of drive space your entire application will fail.
1. You should consider your server as being ephemeral, or temporary. It can be thrown away and replaced by a copy at any time. If you start storing files on the server, then your server has state that cannot be easily replaced.
1. You need backup copies of your application and user files. If you only have one copy of your files on your server, then they will disappear when your server disappears, and you must always assume that your server will disappear.

Instead you want to use a storage service that is specifically designed to support production storage and delivery of files.

## AWS S3

There are many such solutions out there, but one of the most popular ones is [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). S3 provides the following advantages:

1. It has unlimited capacity
1. You only pay for the storage that you use
1. It is optimized for global access
1. It keeps multiple redundant copies of every file
1. You can version the files
1. It is performant
1. It supports metadata tags
1. You can make your files publicly available directly from S3
1. You can keep your files private and only accessible to your application

In this course we will not be using any storage services for the Simon project. If, however, you want to use S3 as the storage service for your Startup application, then you need to learn how to use the AWS SDK. You can find detailed information about using AWS S3 with Node.js on the [AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-started-nodejs.html). Generally, the steps you need to take include:

1. Creating a S3 bucket to store your data in.
1. Getting credentials so that your application can access the bucket.
1. [Using](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) the credentials in your application.
1. Using the [SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/s3-example-creating-buckets.html) to write, list, read, and delete files from the bucket.

⚠ Make sure that you do not include your credentials in your code. If you check your credentials into your GitHub repository they will immediately be stolen and used by hackers to take over your AWS account. This may result in significant monetary damage to you.

# Data services

Web applications commonly need to store application and user data persistently. The data can be many things, but it is usually a representation of complex interrelated objects. This includes things like a user profile, organizational structure, game play information, usage history, billing information, peer relationship, library catalog, and so forth.

![Data service](dataService.jpg)

Historically, SQL databases have served as the general purpose data service solution, but starting around 2010, specialty data services that better support document, graph, JSON, time, sequence, and key-value pair data began to take significant roles in applications from major companies. These data services are often called NoSQL solutions because they do not use the general purpose relational database paradigms popularized by SQL databases. However, they all have very different underlying data structures, strengths, and weaknesses. That means that you should not simply split all of the possible data services into two narrowly defined boxes, SQL and NoSQL, when you are considering the right data service for your application.

Here is a list of some of the popular data services that are available.

| Service       | Specialty             |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| MySQL         | Relational queries    |
| Redis         | Memory cached objects |
| ElasticSearch | Ranked free text      |
| MongoDB       | JSON objects          |
| DynamoDB      | Key value pairs       |
| Neo4J         | Graph based data      |
| InfluxDB      | Time series data      |

## MongoDB

![MongoDB logo](webServicesMongoLogo.png)

For the projects in this course that require data services, we will use `MongoDB`. Mongo increases developer productivity by using JSON objects as its core data model. This makes it easy to have an application that uses JSON from the top to the bottom of the technology stack. A mongo database is made up of one or more collections that each contain JSON documents. You can think of a collection as a large array of JavaScript objects, each with a unique ID. The following is a sample of a collection of houses that are for rent.

```js
[
  {
    _id: '62300f5316f7f58839c811de',
    name: 'Lovely Loft',
    summary: 'A charming loft in Paris',
    beds: 1,
    last_review: {
      $date: '2022-03-15T04:06:17.766Z',
    },
    price: 3000,
  },
  {
    _id: '623010b97f1fed0a2df311f8',
    name: 'Infinite Views',
    summary: 'Modern home with infinite views from the infinity pool',
    property_type: 'House',
    beds: 5,
    price: 250,
  },
];
```

Unlike relational databases that require a rigid table definition where each column must be strictly typed and defined beforehand, Mongo has no strict schema requirements. Each document in the collection usually follows a similar schema, but each document may have specialized fields that are present, and common fields that are missing. This allows the schema of a collection to morph organically as the data model of the application evolves. To add a new field to a Mongo collection you just insert the field into the documents as desired. If the field is not present, or has a different type in some documents, then the document simply doesn't match the query criteria when the field is referenced.

The query syntax for Mongo also follow a JavaScript-inspired flavor. Consider the following queries on the houses for rent collection that was shown above.

```js
// find all houses
db.house.find();

// find houses with two or more bedrooms
db.house.find({ beds: { $gte: 2 } });

// find houses that are available with less than three beds
db.house.find({ status: 'available', beds: { $lt: 3 } });

// find houses with either less than three beds or less than $1000 a night
db.house.find({ $or: [(beds: { $lt: 3 }), (price: { $lt: 1000 })] });

// find houses with the text 'modern' or 'beach' in the summary
db.house.find({ summary: /(modern|beach)/i });
```

### Using MongoDB in your application

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MongoDB tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/node-crud-tutorial/)

The first step to using Mongo in your application is to install the `mongodb` package using NPM.

```sh
➜ npm install mongodb
```

With that done, you then use the `MongoClient` object to make a client connection to the database server. This requires a username, password, and the hostname of the database server.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

const userName = 'holowaychuk';
const password = 'express';
const hostname = 'mongodb.com';

const url = `mongodb+srv://${userName}:${password}@${hostname}`;

const client = new MongoClient(url);
```

With the client connection you can then get a database object and from that a collection object. The collection object allows you to insert, and query for, documents. You do not have to do anything special to insert a JavaScript object as a Mongo document. You just call the `insertOne` function on the collection object and pass it the JavaScript object. When you insert a document, if the database or collection does not exist, Mongo will automatically create them for you. When the document is inserted into the collection it will automatically be assigned a unique ID.

```js
const collection = client.db('rental').collection('house');

const house = {
  name: 'Beachfront views',
  summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
  property_type: 'Condo',
  beds: 1,
};
await collection.insertOne(house);
```

To query for documents you use the `find` function on the collection object. Note that the find function is asynchronous and so we use the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to resolve before we write them out to the console.

```js
const cursor = collection.find();
const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
```

If you do not supply any parameters to the `find` function then it will return all documents in the collection. In this case we only get back the single document that we previously inserted. Notice that the automatically generated ID is returned with the document.

**Output**

```js
[
  {
    _id: new ObjectId('639a96398f8de594e198fc13'),
    name: 'Beachfront views',
    summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
    property_type: 'Condo',
    beds: 1,
  },
];
```

You can provide a query and options to the `find` function. In the example below we query for a `property_type` of Condo that has less than two bedrooms. We also specify the options to sort by descending price, and limit our results to the first 10 documents.

```js
const query = { property_type: 'Condo', beds: { $lt: 2 } };

const options = {
  sort: { price: -1 },
  limit: 10,
};

const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
```

The query matches the document that we previously inserted and so we get the same result as before.

There is a lot more functionality that MongoDB provides, but this is enough to get you started. If you are interested you can explore the tutorials on their [website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).

## Managed services

Historically each application development team would have developers that managed the data service. Those developers would acquire hardware, install the database software, monitor the memory, cpu, and disk space, control the data schema, and handle migrations and upgrades. Much of this work has now moved to services that are hosted and managed by a 3rd party. This relieves the development team from much of the day-to-day maintenance. The team can instead focus more on the application and less on the infrastructure. With a managed data service you simply supply the data and the service grows, or shrinks, to support the desired capacity and performance criteria.

### MongoDB Atlas

All of the major cloud providers offer multiple data services. For this class we will use the data service provided by MongoDB called [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). No credit card or payment is required to set up and use Atlas, as long as you stick to the shared cluster environment.

[![Mongo sign up](webServicesMongoSignUp.jpg)](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

⚠ This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daIH4o75KE8) will step you through the process of creating your account and setting up your database. You really want to watch this video. Note that some of the Atlas website interface may be slightly different, but the basic concepts should all be there in some shape or form. The main steps you need to take are:

1. Create your account.
1. Create a database cluster.
1. Create your root database user credentials. Remember these for later use.
1. ⚠ Set network access to your database to be available from anywhere.

   ![Atlas IP Anywhere](webServicesMongoIpAnywhere.gif)

1. Copy the connection string and use the information in your code.
1. Save the connection and credential information in your production and development environments as instructed above.

You can always find the connection string to your Atlas cluster by pressing the `Connect` button from your Database > DataServices view.

![Atlas connection string](webServicesMongoConnection.gif)

## Keeping your keys out of your code

You need to protect your credentials for connecting to your Mongo database. One common mistake is to check them into your code and then post it to a public GitHub repository. Instead you can load your credentials when the application executes. One common way to do that is to have a JSON configuration file that contains the credentials that you dynamically load into the JavaScript that makes the database connection. You then use the configuration file in your development environment and deploy it to your production environment, but you **never** commit it to GitHub.

In order to accomplish this do the following:

1. Create a file named `dbConfig.json` in the same directory as the database JavaScript (e.g. `database.js`) that you use to make database requests.
1. Insert your Mongo DB credentials into the `dbConfig.json` file in JSON format using the following example:

   ```json
   {
     "hostname": "cs260.abcdefg.mongodb.net",
     "userName": "myMongoUserName",
     "password": "toomanysecrets"
   }
   ```

1. Import the `dbConfig.json` content into your `database.js` file using a Node.js require statement and use the data that it represents to create the connection URL.

   ```js
   const config = require('./dbConfig.json');
   const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
   ```

⚠ Make sure you include `dbConfig.json` in your `.gitignore` file so that it does not get pushed up to GitHub.

### Testing the connection on startup

It is nice to know that your connection string is correct before your application attempts to access any data. We can do that when the application starts by making an asynchronous request to ping the database. If that fails then either the connection string is incorrect, the credentials are invalid, or the network is not working. The following is an example of testing the connection.

```js
const config = require('./dbConfig.json');

const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
const client = new MongoClient(url);
const db = client.db('rental');

(async function testConnection() {
  await client.connect();
  await db.command({ ping: 1 });
})().catch((ex) => {
  console.log(`Unable to connect to database with ${url} because ${ex.message}`);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

If your server is not starting, then check your logs for this exception being thrown.

## Using Mongo from your code

With that all done, you should be good to use Atlas from both your development and production environments. You can test that things are working correctly with the following example.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const config = require('./dbConfig.json');

async function main() {
  // Connect to the database cluster
  const url = `mongodb+srv://${config.userName}:${config.password}@${config.hostname}`;
  const client = new MongoClient(url);
  const db = client.db('rental');
  const collection = db.collection('house');

  // Test that you can connect to the database
  (async function testConnection() {
    await client.connect();
    await db.command({ ping: 1 });
  })().catch((ex) => {
    console.log(`Unable to connect to database with ${url} because ${ex.message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  });

  // Insert a document
  const house = {
    name: 'Beachfront views',
    summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
    property_type: 'Condo',
    beds: 1,
  };
  await collection.insertOne(house);

  // Query the documents
  const query = { property_type: 'Condo', beds: { $lt: 2 } };
  const options = {
    sort: { score: -1 },
    limit: 10,
  };

  const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
  const rentals = await cursor.toArray();
  rentals.forEach((i) => console.log(i));
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

To execute the above example, do the following:

1. Create a directory called `mongoTest`
1. Save the above content to a file named `index.js`
1. Create a file named `dbConfig.json` that contains your database credentials
1. Run `npm init -y`
1. Run `npm install mongodb`
1. Run `node index.js`.

This should output something like the following if everything is working correctly.

```js
{
_id: new ObjectId("639b51b74ef1e953b884ca5b"),
name: 'Beachfront views',
summary: 'From your bedroom to the beach, no shoes required',
property_type: 'Condo',
beds: 1
}
```
