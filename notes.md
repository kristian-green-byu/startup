# CS260 Notes
These notes comprise all my notes for CS260, and they may also be used on exams.
### Git Hub Commands
From the GitHub lesson, several useful commands were shown.

git clone
>clones a repository

git add <file_name> 
>adds a file to a repository

git commit -am "your comment here"
>will commit a change to a repository along with a comment.

git push 
>uploads the changes from your development environment to VSCode

git fetch
>gets the latest information about the changes on GitHub without actually changing your local repository.

git status
>shows the differences between the clones and see that we are missing as a commit.

git pull
>makes your development clone and the GitHub clone the same.

Removing conflicts
>You can remove conflicts by modifying the file to remove the textual conflict delimiters
and modifying the file to keep the changes we want. When we are done editing, our file contains what we want from both commits.

## HTML Info


## Elements and tags

HTML `elements` are represented with enclosing `tags` that may enclose other elements or text. For example, the paragraph element, and its associated tag (`p`), designate that the text is a structural paragraph of text. When we talk about tags we are referring to a delimited textual name that we use to designate the start and end of an HTML element as it appears in an HTML document. Tags are delimited with the less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) symbols. A closing tag will also have a forward slash (`/`) before its name.

```html
<p>Hello world</p>
```

## Attributes

Every HTML element may have attributes. Attributes describe the specific details of the element. For example, the `id` attribute gives a unique ID to the element so that you can distinguish it from other elements. The `class` attribute is another common element attribute that designates the element as being classified into a named group of elements. Attributes are written inside the element tag with a name followed by an optional value. You can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) to delimit attribute values.

```html
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```

## Hyperlinks

One of the core features that made the web so successful was the ability to create hyperlinks that take you from one page to another another with a simple click. A hyperlink in HTML is represented with an anchor (`a`) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (`href`). A hyperlink to BYU's home page looks like this:

```html
<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```

## Common elements

## Comments

You can include comments in your HTML files by starting the comment with `<!--` and ending it with `-->`. Any text withing a comment block will be completely ignored when the browser renders it.

```html
<!-- commented text -->
```

## Special characters

HTML uses several reserved characters for defining its file format. If you want to use those characters in your content then you need to escape them using the `entity` syntax. For example, to display a less than symbol (`<`) you would instead use the less than entity (`&lt;`). You can also use the entity syntax to represent any unicode character.

| Character | Entity      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| &amp;     | `&amp;`     |
| <         | `&lt;`      |
| >         | `&gt;`      |
| "         | `&quot;`    |
| '         | `&apos;`    |
| &#128512; | `&#128512;` |

## Block and inline

There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element `div` (division) could have an inline element `b` in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a `p` (paragraph) element could have a `span` to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

```html
<div>He said <b>don't</b> cross the beams.</div>

<p>Authors such as <span>ee cummings</span> often used unconventional structure.</p>
```

## Form element

The main purpose of the `form` element is to submit the values of the inputs it contains. Before JavaScript was introduced the `form` container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input. With JavaScript we have much more control over input data and what is done with it. For example, in a single page application the JavaScript will dynamically rebuild the HTML elements to reflect the results of the user interaction. With this ability the data may not even be sent to the server. This greatly reduces the necessity of the `form` element, but it is often still used simply as a container. Just remember that you are not required to have a form element to use input elements.

Here is an example of a simple form that submits the value of a `textarea` element.

```html
<form action="submission.html" method="post">
  <label for="ta">TextArea: </label>
  <textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">
Some text
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server. The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's `name` attribute with the current value of the textarea.

```
ta-id=Some+text
```

## Input element

The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the `type` attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

In order to create an input you specify the desired `type` attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

```html
<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label> <input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
```

Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

| Attribute | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form |
| disabled  | Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input                        |
| value     | The initial value of the input                                                      |
| required  | Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid                             |

The following shows what the inputs look like when rendered. Don't worry about how clunky they look right out of the box. We will fix that when we start styling things with CSS.

![HTML Input](htmlInput.jpg)

## Validating input

Several of the input elements have validation built into them. This means that they will not accept a value that is not for example, a number, a URL, outside of a range, or an email address. You can also specify the `required` attribute on an input element to mark it as requiring a value before it can be submitted. The `pattern` attribute exists on `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password` inputs. When present, the pattern attribute provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered as valid.

You should also have validation built into your JavaScript that checks input data to ensure everything is valid before it is submitted. All of the input elements support functions for determining their validation state. Additionally, there are CSS style selectors for visualizing the validity of the input. In order to have a good user experience, it is critical that you provide sufficient user feedback early in the input process. A good design will give feedback as, or before, the user begins to input. A poor design will keep the user guessing as to why the data is not being accepted, or even if it was accepted.

# HTML media elements

The HTML elements that represent media include `img`, `audio`, `video`, `svg`, and `canvas`. The `img`, `audio`, and `video` elements are all simple references to an external file, but `svg` and `canvas` both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.

## External media

The media tags that reference external media all take a URL as an attribute. The path represented by the URL can either be a relative path or full path. A full path includes the protocol, domain name, and path to the file.

```html
https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg
```

A relative path references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element. You want to make the path as relative as possible so that you can move your code around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references. For example, if your HTML page is located in a directory with a subdirectory named `images` that contains a file named `photo.jpg` you would use a relative path as follows.

```html
images/photo.jpg
```

### Image

To include an image in your content you use the `img` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source image.
In order to support accessibility, you should also include an `alt` attribute that describes the image. A full img element would look like the following.

```html
<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />
```

![mountain landscape](htmlImage.jpg)

### Audio

To include an audio file in your content you use the `audio` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source audio file. You can include the `controls` attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The `autoplay` attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the `loop` attribute keeps it playing over and over.

⚠ Note that automatically playing audio is strongly discouraged unless you provide a way for the user to opt-in to that behavior.

```html
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

![Html Audio](htmlAudioImg.jpg)

### Video

To include a video in your content you use the `video` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the `controls` or `autoplay` attributes.

⚠ Note that you may need to include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.

```html
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```

![HTML video](htmlVideoImg.jpg)

## Internal media

The internal media elements `svg` and `canvas` allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.

### Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
</svg>
```

![SVG demo](htmlSvg.jpg)

When combined with JavaScript and CSS you can produce some amazing visualizations. Checkout this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/mdKjMLY) for an example.

Consult the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) if you are interested in learning more about SVG.

### Canvas

The `canvas` element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.

```html
<canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
<script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
</script>
```
