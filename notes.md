# CS260 Notes
These notes comprise all my notes for CS260, and they may also be used on exams.
### Git Hub Commands
From the GitHub lesson, several useful commands were shown.
git clone 
>clones a repository

git add <file_name>
>adds a file to a repository
git commit -am "your comment here"
>will commit a change to a repository along with a comment.
git push
>uploads the changes from your development environment to VSCode
git fetch
>gets the latest information about the changes on GitHub without actually changing your local repository.
git status
>shows the differences between the clones and see that we are missing as a commit.
git pull
>makes your development clone and the GitHub clone the same.
Removing conflicts:
>You can remove conflicts by modifying the file to remove the textual conflict delimiters
>and modifying the file to keep the changes we want.
>When we are done editing, our file contains what we want from both commits.
