##Description Deliverable
Have you ever wanted to keep track of home many hikes you've completed and compete with your friends to see who can accomplish more? With Hiked, you can do just that. Hiked is designed so that you can track the total hikes you finish along with their statistics. The application takes these statistics and imports them into an internal leaderboard system to encourage healthy competition among friends. In addition, Hiked supports leaving reviews so you can plan your trips according to what others have said about specific trails. If you don't know where to begin, Hiked displays the most popular trails on the front page so that you can take inspiration from others and have an adventure.
