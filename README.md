# Hiked
## Description Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
Have you ever wanted to keep track of home many hikes you've completed and compete with your friends to see who can accomplish more? With Hiked, you can do just that. Hiked is designed so that you can track the total hikes you finish along with their statistics. The application takes these statistics and imports them into an internal leaderboard system to encourage healthy competition among friends. In addition, Hiked supports leaving reviews so you can plan your trips according to what others have said about specific trails. If you don't know where to begin, Hiked displays the most popular trails on the front page so that you can take inspiration from others and have an adventure.

### Key Features
- Secure login using HTTPS
- Leaderboard is displayed and updated in realtime
- Displays popular trails
- Ability of admin to edit the trails list
- Users are able to append reviews to trails
- Leaderboard position is updated depending on the total miles that each user inputs

### Technologies
I will use a variety of different programming languages to accomplish my goals.
- HTML: Uses HTML as the backbone of the website and login pages. Hyperlinks are used to go to login or signup pages, and other HTML functionality is used to organize each section of the website.
- CSS: Stylizes the HTML page to make it more aesthetically appealing and compatible with different devices. Uses fundamentals of design such as contrast.
- Javascript: Enables login, submiting miles to the leaderboard, displaying the leaderboard, and supports functionality so that users can add reviews. Will also provide backend endpoint calls. 
- Service: Provides endpoints for login, submitting miles, and retrieving scores or reviews.
- DB: Stores information such as users, miles, and reviews in the database.
- Login: Allows users to register or login. Credentials will be securely stored to prevent dataleaks.
- Websocket: Enables other users to see the leaderboard and reviews for trails.
- React: Application will be designed to function within the React web framework.
